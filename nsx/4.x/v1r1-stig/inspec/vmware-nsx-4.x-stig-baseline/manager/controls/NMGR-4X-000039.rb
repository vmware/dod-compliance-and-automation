    Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks. Password length is one factor of several that helps to determine strength and how long it takes to crack a password.

    The shorter the password, the lower the number of possible combinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised. Use of more characters in a password helps to exponentially increase the time and/or resources required to compromise the password.

  desc 'check', '
    From an NSX Manager shell, run the following command:

    >  get password-complexity

    If the minimum password length is not 15 or greater, this is a finding.

  desc 'fix', '
    From an NSX Manager shell, run the following command:

    > set password-complexity minimum-password-length 15
