  desc 'To mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, privileged access must not automatically give an entity access to an asset or security boundary. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization.

Access control policies include identity-based policies, role-based policies, and attribute-based policies. Access enforcement mechanisms include access control lists, access control matrices, and cryptography.

Controls for this requirement include prevention of non-privileged users from executing privileged functions to include disabling, circumventing, or altering implemented security safeguards/countermeasures; enforcing the use of organization-defined role-based access control policies over defined subjects and objects; and restricting access associated with changes to the system components.
