  title 'The NSX-T Tier-1 Gateway Firewall must deny network communications traffic by default and allow network communications traffic by exception (i.e., deny all, permit by exception).'
  desc 'To prevent malicious or accidental leakage of traffic, organizations must implement a deny-by-default security posture at the network perimeter. Such rulesets prevent many malicious exploits or accidental leakage by restricting the traffic to only known sources and only those ports, protocols, or services that are permitted and operationally necessary. This configuration, which is in the Manager function of the NSX-T implementation, helps prevent the firewall instance from failing to a state that may cause unauthorized access to make changes to the firewall filtering functions.

As a managed boundary interface, the firewall must block all inbound and outbound network traffic unless a filter is installed to explicitly allow it. The configured filters must comply with the Ports, Protocols, and Services Management (PPSM) Category Assurance List (CAL) and Vulnerability Assessment (VA).
