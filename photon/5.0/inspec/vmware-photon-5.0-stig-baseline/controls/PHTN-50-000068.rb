  title 'The Photon operating system must be configured to use TCP syncookies.'
  desc  "A TCP SYN flood attack can cause a Denial of Service (DOS) by filling a system's TCP connection table with connections in the SYN_RCVD state. Syncookies can be used to track a connection when a subsequent ACK is received, verifying the initiator is attempting a valid connection and is not a flood source. This feature is activated when a flood condition is detected and enables the system to continue servicing valid connection requests."
  desc  'rationale', ''
  desc  'check', "
    At the command line, run the following command to verify TCP syncookies are enabled:

    # /sbin/sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies

    Example result:

    net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1

    If \"net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies\" is not set to \"1\", this is a finding.
  "
  desc 'fix', "
    Navigate to and open:

    /etc/sysctl.d/zz-stig-hardening.conf

    Add or update the following line:

    net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1

    At the command line, run the following command to load the new configuration:

    # /sbin/sysctl --load /etc/sysctl.d/zz-stig-hardening.conf

    Note: If the file zz-stig-hardening.conf does not exist it must be created.
