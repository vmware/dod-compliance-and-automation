  title 'The Photon operating system must audit the execution of privileged functions.'
  desc  'Misuse of privileged functions, either intentionally or unintentionally by authorized users, or by unauthorized external entities that have compromised information system accounts, is a serious and ongoing concern and can have significant adverse impacts on organizations. Auditing the use of privileged functions is one way to detect such misuse and identify the risk from insider threats and the advanced persistent threat.'
  desc  'rationale', ''
  desc  'check', "
    At the command line, run the following command to output a list of files with setuid/setgid configured and their corresponding audit rules:

    # for file in $(find / -xdev -path /var/lib/containerd -prune -o \\( -perm -4000 -o -perm -2000 \\) -type f -print | sort); do echo \"Found file with setuid/setgid configured: $file\";rule=\"$(auditctl -l | grep \"$file \")\";echo \"Audit Rule Result: $rule\";echo \"\"; done

    Example output:

    Found file with setuid/setgid configured: /usr/bin/chage
    Audit Rule Result: -a always,exit -S all -F path=/usr/bin/chage -F perm=x -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=-1 -F key=privileged

    Found file with setuid/setgid configured: /usr/bin/chfn
    Audit Rule Result: -a always,exit -S all -F path=/usr/bin/chfn -F perm=x -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=-1 -F key=privileged

    If each file returned does not have a corresponding audit rule, this is a finding.

    Note: This check depends on the \"auditd\" service to be in a running state for accurate results. The \"auditd\" service is enabled in control PHTN-50-000016.

    Note: auid!=-1, auid!=4294967295, auid!=unset are functionally equivalent in this check and the output of the above commands may be displayed in either format.
  "
  desc  'fix', "
    Run the following steps for each file found in the check that does not have a corresponding line in the audit rules:

    Navigate to and open:

    /etc/audit/rules.d/audit.STIG.rules

    Add the following line:

    -a always,exit -F path=<path> -F perm=x -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=unset -F key=privileged

    Run the following command to load the new audit rules:

    # /sbin/augenrules --load

    Note: An \"audit.STIG.rules\" file is provided with this guidance for placement in \"/etc/audit/rules.d\" that contains all rules needed for auditd.
