    Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks.

    Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes to crack a password. The more complex the password, the greater the number of possible combinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised.

    At the command line, run the following command to verify the pam_pwquality.so module is used:

    # grep '^password' /etc/pam.d/system-password

    Example result:

    password required pam_pwhistory.so use_authtok
    password required pam_pwquality.so use_authtok
    password required pam_unix.so sha512 shadow use_authtok

    If the pam_pwquality.so module is not present, this is a finding.

    Navigate to and open:
