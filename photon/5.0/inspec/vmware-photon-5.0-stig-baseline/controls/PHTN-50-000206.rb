    At the command line, run the following command to verify the pam_faildelay.so module is used:

    # grep '^auth' /etc/pam.d/system-auth

    Example result:

    auth required pam_faillock.so preauth
    auth required pam_unix.so
    auth required pam_faillock.so authfail
    auth optional pam_faildelay.so delay=4000000

    If the pam_faildelay.so module is not present with the delay set to at least four seconds, this is a finding.

    Note: The delay is configured in milliseconds.
