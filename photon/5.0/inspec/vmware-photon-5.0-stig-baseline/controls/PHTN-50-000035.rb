  title 'The Photon operating system must enforce password complexity by requiring that at least one uppercase character be used.'
  desc  "
    Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks.

    Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes to crack a password. The more complex the password, the greater the number of possible combinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised.

  desc  'rationale', ''
  desc  'check', "
    At the command line, run the following command to verify at least one uppercase character be used:

    # grep '^ucredit' /etc/security/pwquality.conf

    Example result:

    ucredit = -1

    If the \"ucredit\" option is not < 0, is missing or commented out, this is a finding.

    Note: If pwquality.conf is not used to configure pam_pwquality.so, these options may be specified on the pwquality line in the system-password file.

  desc 'fix', "
    Navigate to and open:

    /etc/security/pwquality.conf

    Add or update the following lines:

    ucredit = -1
