    The shorter the password, the lower the number of possible combinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised.

    Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks. Password length is one factor of several that helps to determine strength and how long it takes to crack a password. Use of more characters in a password helps to exponentially increase the time and/or resources required to compromise the password.

  desc  'rationale', ''
  desc  'check', "
    At the command line, run the following command to verify a minimum 15-character password length:

    # grep '^minlen' /etc/security/pwquality.conf

    Example result:

    minlen = 15

    If the \"minlen\" option is not >= 15, is missing or commented out, this is a finding.

    Note: If pwquality.conf is not used to configure pam_pwquality.so, these options may be specified on the pwquality line in the system-password file.

  desc 'fix', "
    Navigate to and open:

    /etc/security/pwquality.conf

    Add or update the following lines:

    minlen = 15
