    If IP forwarding is required, for example if Kubernetes is installed, this is Not Applicable.

    At the command line, run the following command to verify packet forwarding it disabled:

    # /sbin/sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward

    Expected result:

    net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0

    If the \"net.ipv4.ip_forward\" kernel parameter is not set to \"0\", this is a finding.

    Navigate to and open:

    /etc/sysctl.d/zz-stig-hardening.conf

    Add or update the following line:

    net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0

    At the command line, run the following command to load the new configuration:

    # /sbin/sysctl --load /etc/sysctl.d/zz-stig-hardening.conf

    Note: If the file zz-stig-hardening.conf does not exist it must be created.
