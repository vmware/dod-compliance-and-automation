# VMware Photon OS 4.0 STIG Documentation

## Overview
In the United States Department of Defense (DOD), Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs) provide technical, standards-based hardening guidance. Officially published STIGs are mandatory in the DOD and fill a crucial role in systems accreditation as part of the Risk Management Framework (RMF). VMware has worked with the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) to publish many STIGs over the years and will continue to do so. More information is available in the overview document provided in the download.

The only official reference for DISA STIGs, once approved and published, is the US Department of Defense web site at https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/
