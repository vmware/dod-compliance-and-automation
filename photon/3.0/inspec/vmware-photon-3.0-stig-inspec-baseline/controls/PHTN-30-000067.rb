  title 'The Photon operating system must generate audit records when the sudo command is used.'
  desc  "
    Without generating audit records that are specific to the security and mission needs of the organization, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one.

    Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system (e.g., module or policy filter).
  "
  desc  'rationale', ''
  desc  'check', "
    At the command line, execute the following command:

    # auditctl -l | grep sudo

    Expected result:

    -a always,exit -F path=/usr/bin/sudo -F perm=x -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k privileged

    If the output does not match the expected result, this is a finding.

    Note: The auid!= parameter may display as 4294967295 or -1 which are equivalent.

    Note: This check depends on the auditd service to be in a running state for accurate results. Enabling the auditd service is done in control PHTN-30-000013.

  desc 'fix', "
    Navigate to and open:

    /etc/audit/rules.d/audit.STIG.rules

    Add the following line:

    -a always,exit -F path=/usr/bin/sudo -F perm=x -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -F key=privileged

    Execute the following command to load the new audit rules:

    # /sbin/augenrules --load

    Note: A new audit.STIG.rules file is provided as a supplemental document that can be placed in /etc/audit/rules.d that contains all rules needed for auditd.

    Note: An older audit.STIG.rules may exist if the file exists and references older \"GEN\" SRG IDs. This file can be removed and replaced as necessary with an updated one.
