It should not be used on systems that are routers for complicated networks but is helpful for end hosts and routers serving small networks.'

    At the command line, execute the following command:

    # /sbin/sysctl -a --pattern \"net.ipv4.conf.(all|default|eth.*)\\.rp_filter\"

    Expected result:

    net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter = 1
    net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter = 1
    net.ipv4.conf.eth0.rp_filter = 1

    If the output does not match the expected result, this is a finding.

    Note: The number of \"ethx\" lines returned is dependant on the number of interfaces. Every \"ethx\" entry must be set to \"1\".
