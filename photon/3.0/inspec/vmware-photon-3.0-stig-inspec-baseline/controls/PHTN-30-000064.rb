  title 'The Photon operating system must configure sshd to use FIPS 140-2 ciphers.'
  desc  "
    Privileged access contains control and configuration information and is particularly sensitive, so additional protections are necessary. This is maintained by using cryptographic mechanisms such as encryption to protect confidentiality.

    Nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities are those activities conducted by individuals communicating through a network, either an external network (e.g., the Internet) or an internal network. Local maintenance and diagnostic activities are those activities carried out by individuals physically present at the information system or information system component and not communicating across a network connection.

    This requirement applies to hardware/software diagnostic test equipment or tools. This requirement does not cover hardware/software components that may support information system maintenance, yet are a part of the system (e.g., the software implementing \"ping,\" \"ls,\" \"ipconfig,\" or the hardware and software implementing the monitoring port of an Ethernet switch).

    The operating system can meet this requirement through leveraging a cryptographic module.

    At the command line, execute the following command:

    # sshd -T|&grep -i Ciphers

    Expected result:

    ciphers aes256-gcm@openssh.com,aes128-gcm@openssh.com,aes256-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes128-ctr

    If the output matches the ciphers in the expected result or a subset thereof, this is not a finding.

    If the ciphers in the output contain any ciphers not listed in the expected result, this is a finding.

    Navigate to and open:

    /etc/ssh/sshd_config

    Ensure that the \"Ciphers\" line is uncommented and set to the following:

    Ciphers aes256-gcm@openssh.com,aes128-gcm@openssh.com,aes256-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes128-ctr

    At the command line, execute the following command:

    # systemctl restart sshd.service
