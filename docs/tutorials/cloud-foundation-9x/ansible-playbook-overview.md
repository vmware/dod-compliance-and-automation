# VCF 9.x Ansible Playbook Overview

## Overview
This is an Ansible playbook that can be used to perform automated remediation for STIG compliance of the VMware Cloud Foundation STIGs.  

All Ansible roles needed to remediate STIG compliance for VCF have been consolidated into a single playbook starting in 9.0.0.0.   

{{% alert title="Important" color="warning" %}}
For the best experience, prior to using the STIG automation provided here please ensure you:  
- Have familiarity with the rules contained in the various VMware STIGs and have evaluated them for impact and implementation considerations in the environment.  
- Have an understanding of Ansible playbooks and concepts.
- Have a backout plan so that the changes can be rolled back if necessary.
- Have read the README and understand the structure of the Ansible playbook provided here.

**Failure to do so can result in unintended behavior in the environment.**

## Ansible Concepts

### Playbook Structure
* `inventory_vcf.yml` -  Ansible inventory file for typical VCF deployments. This defines what VCF components will be targeted and how connections are made.  
* `playbook.yml` - Main playbook file that determines which roles run against systems in inventory groups. This is intended for appliance rule based remediation only via SSH.  
* `playbook_api.yml` - API role based playbook file that determines which roles run against systems in inventory groups. This is intended for product rule based remediation only via REST APIs.  
* `requirements.yml` - Used by the `ansible-galaxy` command to install required collections and roles needed by the playbook.  
* `vault_vcf.yml` - Ansible Vault file that defines credentials and other sensitive variables needed by the playbook.  
* `vars_xxx.yml` - Variables files used to supply environment specific values. 
* `/group_vars/xxx.yml` - Variables files that define values specific to inventory groups. These can only overwrite variables defined in role defaults.  
* `/host_vars/xxx.yml` - Variables files that define values specific to inventory hosts. These can only overwrite variables defined in role defaults and group_vars.  
* `/roles/<role name>/defaults/main.yml` - Control ID variables for each STIG rule that can be used to enable or disable specific rules as well as configuration values that may be overwritten for the role. These can be overwritten by supplying a vars file at the command line or in group_vars and host_vars files.  
* `/roles/<role name>/handlers/main.yaml` - Handlers are tasks that only run when notified. For example, a handler can be defined that restarts a specific service and then called from any task that should restart that service when changes occur.  
* `/roles/<role name>/meta/main.yml` - Defines metadata for the role.  
* `/roles/<role name>/tasks/main.yml` - The primary task file for the role. This file usually references other task files in this directory.  
* `/roles/<role name>/templates/` - Template files used by the role.  
* `/roles/<role name>/vars/main.yml` - Variables used in tasks in the role are defined here for static configuration and system values. In this playbook these values are not intended to be overwritten or altered.  
* `/vars/vars_playbook.yml` - Variables defined here are intended to be used throughout the playbook and by multiple roles but are not intended to be altered.
* `/vars/vars_playbook_overrides.yml` - Variables defined here are intended to be used throughout the playbook and by multiple roles.

### Variable Precedence
Variables are used in Ansible to provide values to tasks being invoked that are variable in nature. For example, values for site specific NTP servers or an API token needed to perform a task.

Variables are processed in order of least to greatest precedence, as listed below.  For more information on variable precedence see: [Understanding variable precedence](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_variables.html#understanding-variable-precedence).

* `/roles/<role name>/defaults/main.yml`
* `/group_vars/xxx.yml`
* `/host_vars/xxx.yml`
* `/roles/<role name>/vars/main.yml`
* `/vars/vars_playbook.yml`
* `/vars/vars_playbook_overrides.yml`
* extra vars specified at the CLI with `-e` such as the vault file or a custom vars file.

__NOTE__: It is NOT supported to directly modify variables located in `/vars/vars_playbook.yml`, `/roles/<role name>/vars/main.yml`, `/roles/<role name>/defaults/main.yml`, or sections in group or host vars files inside blocks that state `DO NOT EDIT`. Follow the appropriate instructions to override variable values as needed for the environment. 

### Variable Name Syntax
Variable names provided by this playbook are standardized based on where they originate in order to facilitate easier locating.    

* `/roles/<role name>/defaults/main.yml` - Variables defined in a role in the defaults location will have the syntax `<rolename>_defaults_description`.
* `/roles/<role name>/vars/main.yml` - Variables defined in a role in the vars location will have the syntax `<rolename>_vars_description`.
* `vault_vcf.yml` - Variables originating from Ansible vault will have the syntax `var_vault_<inventory_name>_description`.

### Variable use cases in this playbook and overriding values
Whether variables are used to control the execution of a specific STIG ID or to provide a value for a specific configuration, as a general rule the default values provided are as called for in the STIG rules. The exception to this statement is for values that are site specific such as for NTP or syslog servers where the value is empty by default and must be provided by the end user for the playbook to function properly.

#### Supported variable override locations and methods
It is supported to override role variables in the following ways:

* Adding target variables to `/group_vars/xxx.yml` files for a specific inventory group. For example, to set an NTP server for all NSX Managers update the `/group_vars/nsxmanager.yml` file.
* Adding target variables to `/host_vars/xxx.yml` files for a specific inventory host. For example, to set an NTP server for a single NSX Manager update the `/host_vars/nsx_mgmt_mgr_1.yml` file.
* Adding target variables to the `/vars/vars_playbook_overrides.yml` file to override variables for all roles. For example, to disable the Photon rule that configures the DOD login banner for SSH on all inventory targets update `photon_5_defaults_run_phtn_50_000005_dod_banner: true` to `false`.
* By specifying a custom vars file during playbook execution with the `-e` argument.

#### Variable override use cases

* Disabling specific STIG rules.
  * Each STIG rule present in this playbook has a variable defined that controls the execution of that rule.
  * To override the default execution for a rule, locate the target role and review the `/defaults/main.yml` file for the available rule specific variables, such as `photon_5_defaults_run_phtn_50_000044: true`, and update the value in a supported location.
* Providing environment specific values.
  * Environment specific values exist for some rules, such as to configure site specific NTP or syslog servers.
* Altering the STIG recommended value for a specific rule.
  * In rare cases a user may need to waiver a specific rule and/or alter the default value used by the playbook.
  * To override a configuration value, locate the target role and review the `/defaults/main.yml` file for the available configuration specific variables, such as `photon_5_defaults_pam_pwquality_minlen: 15`, and update the value in a supported location.

### Inventory
Ansible inventory is a list or groups of lists of the hosts (or VCF appliances in this case) that are targets of the Ansible playbook. The playbook is designed to target specific roles against specific inventory hosts.  

For example, from the `playbook.yml` file these are the roles that will run against hosts in the vcenter inventory group:
```
- name: vmware-cloud-foundation-vcenter-stig-ansible-hardening
  hosts: vcenter
  roles:
    - role: photon_5
    - role: vcenter_envoy
    - role: vcenter_postgresql
    - role: vcenter_vami
```

The `inventory_vcf.yml` file serves as a starting point to building inventory for the target environment, and represents what a single site deployment typically consists of. As each environment is different in regards to the number of workload domains, sites, clustered deployments, and components deployed an inventory file needs to be tailored to fit.

#### Inventory Customization
Depending on the size of the VCF instance a single inventory file may be sufficient, or if multiple sites/instances are deployed it may make sense to create an inventory file for each.

Inventory Guidelines
* Do not alter the group names since these are tied to specific roles in the playbook files.
* Host names in a group can be changed or hosts added to a group as needed.
  * If host specific variables are desired, a corresponding file matching the hostname must exist in the `host_vars` folder.
  * Use only lowercase and underscores when adding hosts.
  * If adding hosts make sure the variable used for `ansible_password` has a corresponding entry in the vault file being used.
* Do not add new groups

Default inventory for vCenter servers in `inventory_vcf.yml`:
```
vcenter:
  hosts:
    vcenter_mgmt:
      ansible_host:
      ansible_user: root
      ansible_password: "{{ var_vault_vcenter_mgmt_root_password }}"
    vcenter_wld_1:
      ansible_host:
      ansible_user: root
      ansible_password: "{{ var_vault_vcenter_wld_1_root_password }}"
```

Customized example inventory for vCenter servers:
```
vcenter:
  hosts:
    vcenter_mgmt: 
      ansible_host: vcenter-mgmt.domain.local
      ansible_user: root
      ansible_password: "{{ var_vault_vcenter_mgmt_root_password }}"
    vcenter_wld_1:
      ansible_host: vcenter-wld-1.domain.local
      ansible_user: root
      ansible_password: "{{ var_vault_vcenter_wld_1_root_password }}"
    vcenter_wld_2:
      ansible_host: vcenter-wld-2.domain.local
      ansible_user: root
      ansible_password: "{{ var_vault_vcenter_wld_2_root_password }}"
```

### Tags
Ansible tags are primarily used in this playbook to associate STIG rules with specific tasks. These are useful in targeting specific tasks for a run.

Tags associated with STIG IDs for tasks example:
```
- name: PHTN-50-000005
  tags: [PHTN-50-000005, sshd]
  when: photon_5_defaults_run_phtn_50_000005 | bool
  block:
    - name: 'PHTN-50-000005 - Configure DoD Banner in {{ photon_5_vars_etc_issue_file }}.'
```

Tags are also present for each role so that a single role may be targeted for a run. These tags match the role name, except with a "-", for example:
```
- name: Include vCenter PostgreSQL tasks
  ansible.builtin.include_tasks:
    file: postgresql.yml
    apply:
      tags:
        - vcenter-postgresql
  tags:
    - vcenter-postgresql
```

### Using Ansible Vault
[Ansible vault](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/vault_guide/index.html) provides a way to encrypt and manage sensitive data such as passwords.  

**!!It is critical that care is taken with the vault file and that it does not get left unencrypted!!**

Before running the playbook, the `vault_vcf.yml` file or a copy or alternative vault file needs to be updated with the credentials needed for the playbook to run.

After updating the file it needs to be encrypted. For more information on how the vault is encrypted see: [Format of files encrypted with Ansible Vault](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/vault_guide/vault_using_encrypted_content.html#format-of-files-encrypted-with-ansible-vault)  

__NOTE__: All command examples below are assumed to be run from the folder where the vault file resides.  

To encrypt the vault file, run the following command and supply a password for encryption:
```
ansible-vault encrypt vault_vcf.yml
```
To view an encrypted vault file, run the following command:
```
ansible-vault view vault_vcf.yml
```
To edit an encrypted vault file, run the following command:
```
ansible-vault edit vault_vcf.yml
```
To change the password on an encrypted vault file, run the following command:
```
ansible-vault rekey vault_vcf.yml
```
To decrypt the vault file, run the following command:
```
ansible-vault decrypt vault_vcf.yml
```

## Running the playbook
__NOTE__: All command examples below are assumed to be run from the playbook folder and all required credentials and variables have already been populated.  

### File level backups
Each role, if applicable, contains a task that runs before any changes are made that backs up any files the role can potentially modify.  

The backup files are saved to `/tmp/ansible-backups-*{{ backup_timestamp }}/` which will be unique to each playbook run. Files saved under /tmp retain their original ownership and permissions.

When restoring files from these backups it is recommended to use the `-p` argument with the `cp` command to maintain the files permissions, owners, and timestamps. For example:  `cp -p source destination`  

If desired this backup task can be disabled by changing the variable `create_backups: true` to `false` in a supported vars override location.  

### General Ansible Playbook arguments

These arguments are commonly used for various use cases when running this playbook:
* `-v` - Causes Ansible to print more verbose output. Can be increased by adding more v's up to `-vvvvvv`.
* `-i` - Specifies an inventory target or inventory file to run against.
* `-l` - Limits the selection of hosts to run the playbook against. Normally should be used to not run against everything in inventory. For example only run against vCenter servers.
* `-e` - Set additional variables in key=value format via a file if prepended with @. Using with a file is the most common.
* `--ask-vault-pass` - Prompt for vault password.
* `--tags` - Only run tasks with specific tags. This is most commonly used to target a specific STIG ID. For example: `--tags PHTN-50-000003,PHTN-50-000005`
* `--skip-tags` - Only run tasks that DO NOT match specific tags.

### Remediating VCF appliances
