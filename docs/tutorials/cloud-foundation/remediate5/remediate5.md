# Remediate VCF 5.x

## Overview
Remediating VCF for STIG compliance involves running an Ansible playbook against the target SDDC Manager appliance over SSH to configure any non-compliant controls.    

Remediating other components of a VCF deployment such as [vSphere](../../vsphere/vsphere.md) and [NSX](../../nsx/nsx.md) is documented in those sections on this site.
