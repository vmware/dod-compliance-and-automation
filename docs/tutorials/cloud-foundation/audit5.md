# Audit VCF 5.x

## Overview
Auditing VCF for STIG compliance involves scanning the SDDC Manager appliance.  

Scanning other components of a VCF deployment such as [vSphere](../vSphere/) and [NSX](../NSX/) is documented in those sections on this site.

### Prerequisites
Versions listed below were used for this documentation. Other versions of these tools may work as well but if issues are found it is recommended to try the versions listed here.  

* InSpec/CINC Auditor 6.6.0
* SAF CLI 1.4.0
* STIG Viewer 2.17
* A VCF 5.x environment.
* An account with access to VCF.

### Assumptions
* Commands are being run from a Linux machine. Windows will also work but paths and commands may need to be adjusted from the examples.
* The [DOD Compliance and Automation](https://github.com/vmware/dod-compliance-and-automation) repository has been downloaded and extracted to `/usr/share/stigs`.
* CINC Auditor is used in lieu of InSpec. If InSpec is used replace `cinc-auditor` with `inspec` when running commands.

## Auditing SDDC Manager
The example commands below are specific to the product version and the supported STIG content for the version being run. Select the example command tabs for the version in the environment.


### Generate bearer token for SDDC Manager
The SDDC Manager InSpec profile connects to the API via a bearer token to query some configurations when auditing.

This example uses curl to generate a token. This can also be done via other methods such as Postman or the UI as shown below. 

<table>
<tr><td style='width: 15%;'>**Version:***</td><td>**Syntax:**</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>5.2.1.x<br />
    5.2.0.x<br />
    5.1.x<br />
    5.0.x
</td>
<td>

```
curl -k 'https://sddc-manager.vrack.vsphere.local/v1/tokens' -i -X POST \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Accept: application/json' \
    -d '{
  "username" : "administrator@vsphere.local",
  "password" : "replaceme"
}'
```

</td></tr>
</table>

A token can also be UI generated by going to the Developer Center >> API Explorer >> Tokens.  
![Token Generation](../../../images/vcf5_generate_token.png)

Retrieve token by copying the value in the `accessToken` field.

### Update profile inputs
Included in the `vmware-cloud-foundation-sddcmgr-5x-stig-baseline` is an example inputs file with variables relevant to SDDC Manager. This is used to provide InSpec with values specific to the environment being audited.

Open the inputs file for editing.

### Version: 5.2.1.x
```
cd /usr/share/stigs/vcf/5.x/v1r4-srg/inspec/vmware-cloud-foundation-sddcmgr-5x-stig-baseline/

myVmwareAccount: 'myvmwarevcfaccount@test.local'
```

### Update the SSH config to allow scan
By default the SDDC Manager appliance does not allow root SSH and the `vcf` does not have the required privileges to complete the scan so root SSH must be temporarily enabled to complete the scan. These steps can be reversed once the audit is complete.  

```bash
# Allow root SSH into SDDC manager
ssh vcf@sddc-manager.vsphere.local
su -
vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# Update PermitRootLogin from no to yes and save
systemctl restart sshd
```

### Run the audit
In this example a target SDDC Manager will be scanned, specifying an inputs file, and outputting a report to the CLI and to a JSON file ran from a linux machine.

## Convert the results to CKL
If a STIG Viewer CKL file is needed then the results from the scans can be converted to CKL with the [SAF CLI](/docs/automation-tools/safcli/).

```powershell
# Converting the VCSA scan results from the prior section to CKL
saf convert hdf2ckl -i /tmp/reports/VCF_5.2.1.0_SDDC_Manager_STIG_Report.json -o /tmp/reports/VCF_5.2.1.0_SDDC_Manager_STIG_Report.ckl --hostname sddc-manager.vsphere.local --fqdn sddc-manager.vsphere.local --ip 10.2.3.4 --mac 00:00:00:00:00:00
```

Opening the CKL file in STIG Viewer will look like the screenshot below. Note the InSpec results are included in the `Finding Details` pane.
