## [ESXI-80-000247] PowerCLI cmdlets in check and fix text are not found

Related issue: None

When running the check and/or fix commands PowerCLI will error or report that the cmdlet is not found.  

### Workaround
- The new cmdlets did not exist until PowerCLI 13.3. Update to PowerCLI 13.3 where the cmdlets are available.
