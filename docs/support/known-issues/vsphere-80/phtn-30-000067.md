## [PHTN-30-000067] -S all is displayed in the check output
This issue was resolved with the release of the VMware vSphere 8.0 vCenter Appliance Photon OS 4.0 STIG Readiness Guide :: Version 1, Release: 2.  

Related issue: None

Since we are not specifying a specific syscall(all is implied) in the audit rules for these controls the "-S all" is displayed in the auditctl command output which is not included in the expected output in the check.  

### Workaround
- The check output will be updated in a future update and the output with "-S all" added can be considered compliant.
