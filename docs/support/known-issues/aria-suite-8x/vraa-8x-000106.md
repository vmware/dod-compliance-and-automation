## [VRAA-8X-000106] CPU limit setting varies by deployment size.

Related issue: None

Depending on the size selected at deployment, the Aria Automation appliance may contain one of several different values for the cpuLimit option returned by the kubectl command. Current known values include "500m", "2000m", and "2". It is not recommended to change this value from its out of the box setting, and the intent of the control is to ensure the value has not been changed since deployment.

### Workaround
- The check output will be updated in a future release and the output with "500m", "2000m" or "2" as the value for the CPU limit can be considered compliant.
