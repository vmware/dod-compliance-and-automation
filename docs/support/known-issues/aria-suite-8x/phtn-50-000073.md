## [PHTN-50-000073] Aria Operations - Commands in check and fix do not produce expected results
Related issue: None

Running commands to check or fix permissions and file ownership on the '/var/log' directory always returns a value of 777, even after attempting to update the permissions. 

### Workaround
- The `/var/log` entry is a symbolic link to the `/storage/log/var/log` directory, so the check needs to be performed on the underlying directory rather than on the symlink itself. This can be accomplished by any of the following methods:
  - Add a trailing slash ("/") to the directory in any commands 
    - stat -c "..." /var/log/
    - chmod 0755 /var/log/
  - Use the underlying folder instead
    - stat -c "..." /storage/log/var/log
    - chmod 0755 /storage/log/var/log
