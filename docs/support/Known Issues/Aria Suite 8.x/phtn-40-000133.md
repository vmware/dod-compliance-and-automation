## [PHTN-40-000133] Aria Operations - Require users to reauthenticate for privilege escalation
Related issue: None

The intent of this control is to ensure that accounts/permissions out of the box haven't been changed. The two accounts returned ("mpuser" and "admin") are both ok, as long as others are not returned. In future revisions of the STIG content for Operations (Photon 5 and later), this control has been removed.

### Workaround
- Utilize the waiver process to remove the control from the audit scope.
- If utilizing InSpec, include the "skip_control" directive:
  - In the file "aria/operations/8.x/v1r3-srg/inspec/vmware-aria-operations-8x-stig-inspec-baseline/controls/photon.rb"
  - Add a line for "skip_control 'PHTN-40-000133'", instructing InSpec to skip that control when performing the audit.
