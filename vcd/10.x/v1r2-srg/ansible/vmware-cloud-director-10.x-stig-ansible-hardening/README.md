VMware Cloud Director 10.4 STIG Readiness Guide Ansible Playbook  
Version: Version 1 Release 1: July 14, 2022    
STIG Type: STIG Readiness Guide  

## Overview
This is a hardening playbook that utilizes Ansible to perform automated remediation for STIG compliance of the VMware Cloud Director 10.4 STIG Readiness Guide.  

## Requirements
- [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/index.html) installed on a machine that can SSH to the target node(s).  Tested with Ansible 2.12.4.
- SSH access to target server if not running it locally
- Sudo access to target server if needed

## Playbook Structure

- playbook.yml - Main playbook to run
- requirements.yml - Requirements file for installing dependencies or other roles included in this playbook
- /roles/\<role name>/defaults/main.yml - Default variables used to turn controls on/off in the playbook.  Set these to true/false
- /roles/\<role name>/handlers/main.yaml - handlers referenced in the tasks
- /roles/\<role name>/tasks/main.yml - Default role playbook
- /roles/\<role name>/templates - Any template files used in the role
- /roles/\<role name>/vars/main.yml - variables referenced by tasks.  Update these variables as needed for your environment.

## How to run

Run all controls on a single host. Prompts for user password and displays verbose output  
```
ansible-playbook -i 'IP or FQDN', -u 'username' playbook.yml -k -v -b
```
Run all controls on a single host and only for a specific control DKER-CE-000001. Prompts for user password and displays verbose output  
```
ansible-playbook -i 'IP or FQDN', -u 'username' playbook.yml -k -v -b --tags DKER-CE-000001  
```
Run all controls on a single host and only for a specific group of controls for containerd. Prompts for user password and displays verbose output  
```
ansible-playbook -i 'IP or FQDN', -u 'username' playbook.yml -k -v -b --tags containerd  
```
Run all controls on a single host and only for controls tagged 'log_opts' and also supplies variables at the command line. Prompts for user password and displays verbose output
```
ansible-playbook -i 'IP or FQDN', -u 'username' playbook.yml -k -v -b --tags log_opts --extra-vars '{"log_opts_max_size": "100m", "log_opts_max_file": "2"}'
```

## Misc
- If vars need to be updated we recommend either creating a vars file to specify at the command line or adding them to the main playbook.yml or your own playbook.yml so that it is easy to track what is being altered from the original state.  
- Requirements can be installed by running
```
ansible-galaxy roles install -r requirements.yml
```
