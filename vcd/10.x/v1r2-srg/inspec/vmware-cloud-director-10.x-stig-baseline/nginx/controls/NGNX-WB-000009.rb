    A user session to a web server is in the context of a user accessing a hosted application that extends to any plug-ins/modules and services that may execute on behalf of the user.

    The web server must be capable of enabling a setting for troubleshooting, debugging, or forensic gathering purposes which will log all user session information related to the hosted application session. Without the capability to capture, record, and log all content related to a user session, investigations into suspicious user activity would be hampered.

    Example configuration:

    http {
      access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log custom;
    }

    If the access_log directive is not configured in the http block, this is a finding.
