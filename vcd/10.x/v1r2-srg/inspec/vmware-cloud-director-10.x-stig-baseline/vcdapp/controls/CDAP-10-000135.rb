    HTTP response splitting occurs when:

    Data enters a web application through an untrusted source, most frequently an HTTP request or the data is included in an HTTP response header sent to a web user without being validated for malicious characters.

    HTTP response splitting is a means to an end, not an end in itself. At its root, the attack is straightforward: an attacker passes malicious data to a vulnerable application, and the application includes the data in an HTTP response header.

    Cloud Director includes a configuration that when enabled prevents host header injection by comparing the host header against an allow list comprised of the allowed origins, the public endpoint, and cell endpoint.

  desc  'check', "
    Verify host header checks are configured by running the following command:

    # /opt/vmware/vcloud-director/bin/cell-management-tool manage-config -n vcloud.http.enableHostHeaderCheck -l

    Expected result:

    Property \"vcloud.http.enableHostHeaderCheck\" has value \"true\"

    If \"vcloud.http.enableHostHeaderCheck\" does not exist or is set to false, this is a finding.

    At the command prompt, execute the following command:

    # /opt/vmware/vcloud-director/bin/cell-management-tool manage-config -n vcloud.http.enableHostHeaderCheck -v true
