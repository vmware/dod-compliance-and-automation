    From the Cloud Director provider interface, go to Administration >> Certificate Management >> Trusted Certificates.

    Review the list of trusted certificates for any that are expired, revoked, or no longer needed and trusted.

    If any certificates are present that are expired, revoked, or no longer trusted, this is a finding.

    From the Cloud Director provider interface, go to Administration >> Certificate Management >> Trusted Certificates.

    Select the target certificate then click Delete then Delete again on the confirmation screen.

    Note: It is critical that you verify a certificates usage before deleting it to avoid any disruption of services as certificates that are expired may still be in use for an active connection and should be updated before deleting the expired certificate.
