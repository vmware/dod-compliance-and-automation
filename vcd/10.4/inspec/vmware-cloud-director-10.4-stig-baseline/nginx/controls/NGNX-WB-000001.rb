  title 'NGINX must limit the number of allowed simultaneous session requests.'
  desc  "
    Web server management includes the ability to control the number of users and user sessions that utilize a web server. Limiting the number of allowed users and sessions per user is helpful in limiting risks related to several types of Denial of Service attacks.

    Although there is some latitude concerning the settings themselves, the settings should follow DoD-recommended values, but the settings should be configurable to allow for future DoD direction. While the DoD will specify recommended values, the values can be adjusted to accommodate the operational requirement of a given system.

    Verify a shared memory zone has been established in the http block to track connections per server.

    View the running configuration by running the following command:

    # nginx -T

    Example configuration:

    http {
      limit_conn_zone $server_name zone=per_server:10m;
      limit_conn per_server 1000;
    }

    If the limit_conn_zone option is not configured in the http block to limit connections per server, this is a finding.

    If the limit_conn option is not configured in the http block to limit connections per server, this is a finding.

    Note: limit_conn directives under server or location blocks are acceptable to modify limits based on application needs as long as they are not disabled.

    Navigate to and open:

    The nginx.conf (/etc/nginx/nginx.conf by default) file.

    Add the following or similar line(s) in the http block:

    limit_conn_zone $server_name zone=per_server:10m;
    limit_conn per_server 1000;

    Reload the NGINX configuration by running the following command:

    # nginx -s reload
