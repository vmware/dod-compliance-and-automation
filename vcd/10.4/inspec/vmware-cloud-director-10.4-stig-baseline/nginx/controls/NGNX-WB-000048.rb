  title 'Cookies exchanged between NGINX and a client, such as session cookies, must have security settings that disallow cookie access outside the originating web server and hosted application.'
  desc  "
    Cookies are used to exchange data between the web server and the client. Cookies, such as a session cookie, may contain session information and user credentials used to maintain a persistent connection between the user and the hosted application since HTTP/HTTPS is a stateless protocol.

    When the cookie parameters are not set properly (i.e., domain and path parameters), cookies can be shared within hosted applications residing on the same web server or to applications hosted on different web servers residing on the same domain.

  desc  'rationale', ''
  desc  'check', "
    Verify a header is configured to configure cookie security.

    View the running configuration by running the following command:

    # nginx -T

    Example configuration:

    server {
      add_header Set-Cookie \"Path=/; HttpOnly; Secure\";
    }

    If a header is not configured as shown in the example in the http, server, or location block, this is a finding.

    Note: There can be several add_header directives. These directives are inherited from the previous configuration level if and only if there are no add_header directives defined on the current level so care must be taken if add_header is defined at multiple levels to include headers configured at a higher level.
  "
  desc 'fix', "
    Navigate to and open:

    The nginx.conf (/etc/nginx/nginx.conf by default or the included file where the server is defined) file.

    Add or update the \"add_header Set-Cookie\" directive, for example:

    add_header Set-Cookie \"Path=/; HttpOnly; Secure\";

    Reload the NGINX configuration by running the following command:

    # nginx -s reload

    Note: There can be several add_header directives. These directives are inherited from the previous configuration level if and only if there are no add_header directives defined on the current level so care must be taken if add_header is defined at multiple levels to include headers configured at a higher level.
