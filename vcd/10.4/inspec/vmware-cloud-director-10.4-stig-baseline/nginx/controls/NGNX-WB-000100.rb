    The keep alive timeout sets a timeout during which a keep-alive client connection will stay open on the server side.

    Setting a keep alive timeout on the server side helps mitigate denial of service attacks that establish too many persistent connections, exhausting server resources.

    Verify the keep alive timeout is not disabled.

    View the running configuration by running the following command:

    # nginx -T 2>&1 | grep \"keepalive_timeout\"

    Example configuration:

    http {
      keepalive_timeout 60s;
    }

    If the the directive \"keepalive_timeout\" is configured and set to 0 or more than the default of 75, this is a finding.

    If the directive \"keepalive_timeout\" is not configured, this is NOT a finding.
  "
  desc 'fix', "
    Navigate to and open:

    The nginx.conf (/etc/nginx/nginx.conf by default or the included file where the directive was configured) file.

    Remove or update the \"keepalive_timeout\" directive to a value > 0 and <= 75, for example:

    keepalive_timeout 60s;

    Reload the NGINX configuration by running the following command:

    # nginx -s reload
