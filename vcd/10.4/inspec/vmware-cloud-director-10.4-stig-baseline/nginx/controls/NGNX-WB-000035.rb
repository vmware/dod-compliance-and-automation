    At the command line, run the following command:

    # nginx -T 2>&1 | grep \"^user\"

    Example result:

    user www-data www-data;

    If the user directive is not set, this is a finding.

    Establish a non-privileged account to run NGINX worker processes.

    This account should no be a part of any unneeded groups, have sudo access, or the ability to login interactively.

    Navigate to and open:

    The nginx.conf (/etc/nginx/nginx.conf by default) file.

    Add the following line in the main context at the top of the file:

    user <username> <groupname>;

    Reload the NGINX configuration by running the following command:

    # nginx -s reload

    Note: If the group is not the same as the user name it can be specified in this format, user <username> <group>;.
