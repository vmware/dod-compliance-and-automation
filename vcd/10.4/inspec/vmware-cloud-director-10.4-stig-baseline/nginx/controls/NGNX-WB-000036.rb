  title 'NGINX must not have any symbolic links that traverse outside the web content directory tree.'
  desc  "
    A web server is designed to deliver content and execute scripts or applications on the request of a client or user.  Containing user requests to files in the directory tree of the hosted web application and limiting the execution of scripts and applications guarantees that the user is not accessing information protected outside the application's realm.

    The web server must also prohibit users from jumping outside the hosted application directory tree through access to the user's home directory, symbolic links or shortcuts, or through search paths for missing files.

  desc  'rationale', ''
  desc  'check', "
    Verify web content directories do not contain symbolic links that traverse outside the web content directory tree.

    View the defined root directories by running the following command:

    # nginx -T 2>&1 | grep root

    Example output:

    root /opt/mywebsite/www;

    For each root directive, run the following command:

    # find /opt/mywebsite/www/ -type l -ls

    If the any symbolic links are defined that traverse outside the root web directory, this is a finding.
  "
  desc  'fix', "
    Any content referenced through a symbolic link outside of the root web directory should be moved into the root web directory.

    To remove a symbolic link, run the following command:

    # unlink <file_name>

    Repeat the command for each file that was returned.
