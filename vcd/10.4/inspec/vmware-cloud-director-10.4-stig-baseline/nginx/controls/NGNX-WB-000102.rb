  desc  "Perfect forward secrecy is an encryption mechanism that enables past session keys to not be compromised even if the server's private key is compromised. If an attacker recorded all traffic to a server and stored it and then obtained the private key without perfect forward secrecy, all communications would be compromised. With perfect forward secrecy, session keys are generated using Diffie-Hellman for every session a user initiates, which isolates session compromise to only that communication session. Allowing session resumption breaks perfect forward secrecy; this expands the surface area for an attacker to compromise past sessions and communications with a server if they are able to compromise the session."

    If TLS 1.3 only is configured, this is NOT applicable.

    Verify that SSL session tickets are disabled.

    View the running configuration by running the following command:

    # nginx -T 2>&1 | grep \"ssl_session_tickets\"

    Example configuration:

    http {
      ssl_session_tickets off;
    }

    If the the \"ssl_session_tickets\" directive is not set to off in the http block, this is a finding.

    If the \"ssl_session_tickets\" directive is configured in a server or location block and set to on, this is a finding.

    Navigate to and open:

    The nginx.conf (/etc/nginx/nginx.conf by default) file.

    Add the \"ssl_session_tickets\" directive to the http block, for example:

    ssl_session_tickets off;

    Remove any \"ssl_session_tickets\" from server and location blocks.

    Reload the NGINX configuration by running the following command:

    # nginx -s reload
