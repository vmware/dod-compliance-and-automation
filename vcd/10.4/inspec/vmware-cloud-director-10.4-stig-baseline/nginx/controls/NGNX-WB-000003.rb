    The web server has several remote communications channels. Examples are user requests via http/https, communication to a backend database, or communication to authenticate users. The encryption used to communicate must match the data that is being retrieved or presented.

    Methods of communication are http for publicly displayed information, https to encrypt when user data is being transmitted, VPN tunneling, or other encryption methods to a database.

    Verify ssl is enabled for each server block.

    View the running configuration by running the following command:

    # nginx -T

    Example configuration:

    server {
      listen 443 ssl;
    }

    If the ssl option is not specified on the listen directive for a server block, this is a finding.
  "
  desc 'fix', "
    Navigate to and open:

    The nginx.conf (/etc/nginx/nginx.conf by default or the included file where the server is defined) file.

    Add the ssl option to the servers listen directive, for example:

    listen 443 ssl;

    Reload the NGINX configuration by running the following command:

    # nginx -s reload

    Note: The ssl_certificate and ssl_certificate_key also need to be defined in order for SSL to work.
