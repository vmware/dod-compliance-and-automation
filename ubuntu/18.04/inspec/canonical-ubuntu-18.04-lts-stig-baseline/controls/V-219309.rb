conducted by individuals communicating through a network, either an external
network (e.g., the Internet) or an internal network. Local maintenance and
diagnostic activities are those activities carried out by individuals
physically present at the information system or information system component
and not communicating across a network connection. Typically, strong
authentication requires authenticators that are resistant to replay attacks and
employ multifactor authentication. Strong authenticators include, for example,
PKI where certificates are stored on a token protected by a password,
passphrase, or biometric."

    Verify the Ubuntu operating system is configured to use strong
authenticators in the establishment of nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic
maintenance.

    Check that \"UsePAM\" is set to yes in /etc/ssh/sshd_config:

    # grep UsePAM /etc/ssh/sshd_config

    UsePAM yes

    If \"UsePAM\" is not set to \"yes\", this is a finding.
