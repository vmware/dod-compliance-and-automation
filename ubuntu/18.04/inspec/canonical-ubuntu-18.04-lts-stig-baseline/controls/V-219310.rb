  title "The Ubuntu operating system must immediately terminate all network
connections associated with SSH traffic after a period of inactivity."
  desc  "Automatic session termination addresses the termination of
user-initiated logical sessions in contrast to the termination of network
connections that are associated with communications sessions (i.e., network
disconnect). A logical session (for local, network, and remote access) is
initiated whenever a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) accesses an
organizational information system. Such user sessions can be terminated (and
thus terminate user access) without terminating network sessions.

    Session termination terminates all processes associated with a user's
logical session except those processes that are specifically created by the
user (i.e., session owner) to continue after the session is terminated.

    Conditions or trigger events requiring automatic session termination can
include, for example, organization-defined periods of user inactivity, targeted
responses to certain types of incidents, and time-of-day restrictions on
information system use.

    This capability is typically reserved for specific Ubuntu operating system
functionality where the system owner, data owner, or organization requires
additional assurance.

    Verify that all network connections associated with SSH traffic
automatically terminate after a period of inactivity.

    Check that \"ClientAliveCountMax\" variable is set in
\"/etc/ssh/sshd_config\" file by performing the following command:

    # sudo grep -i clientalivecountmax /etc/ssh/sshd_config

    ClientAliveCountMax 1

    If \"ClientAliveCountMax\" is not set, or not set to \"1\", or is commented
out, this is a finding.
  "
  desc 'fix', "
    Configure the Ubuntu operating system to automatically terminate inactive
SSH sessions after a period of inactivity.

    Modify or append the following line in the \"/etc/ssh/sshd_config\" file
replacing \"[Count]\" with a value of 1:

    ClientAliveCountMax 1

    In order for the changes to take effect, the SSH daemon must be restarted.

    # sudo systemctl restart sshd.service
