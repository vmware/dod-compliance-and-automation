permissive."
  desc  "If the operating system were to allow any user to make changes to
software libraries, then those changes might be implemented without undergoing
the appropriate testing and approvals that are part of a robust change
management process.

    This requirement applies to operating systems with software libraries that
are accessible and configurable, as in the case of interpreted languages.
Software libraries also include privileged programs which execute with
escalated privileges. Only qualified and authorized individuals must be allowed
to obtain access to information system components for purposes of initiating
changes, including upgrades and modifications.

    Verify the system-wide shared library files contained in the directories
\"/lib\", \"/lib64\" and \"/usr/lib\" have mode 0755 or less permissive.

    Check that the system-wide shared library files have mode 0755 or less
permissive with the following command:

    # sudo find /lib /lib64 /usr/lib -perm /022 -type f -exec stat -c \"%n %a\"
'{}' \\;
    /usr/lib64/pkcs11-spy.so

    If any files are found to be group-writable or world-writable, this is a
finding.
  "
  desc 'fix', "
    Configure the library files to be protected from unauthorized access. Run
the following command:

    # sudo find /lib /lib64 /usr/lib -perm /022 -type f -exec chmod 755 '{}' \\;
