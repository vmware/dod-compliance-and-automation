    Verify that the shadow password suite configuration is set to encrypt
password with a FIPS 140-2 approved cryptographic hashing algorithm.

    Check the hashing algorithm that is being used to hash passwords with the
following command:

    # cat /etc/login.defs | grep -i crypt

    ENCRYPT_METHOD SHA512

    If \"ENCRYPT_METHOD\" does not equal SHA512 or greater, this is a finding.
