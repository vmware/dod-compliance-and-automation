unintended side effects, some of which may be relevant to security.

    Detecting such changes and providing an automated response can help avoid

    Verify that Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment (AIDE) notifies the
system administrator when anomalies in the operation of any security functions
are discovered.

    Check that AIDE notifies the system administrator when anomalies in the
operation of any security functions are discovered with the following command:

    #sudo grep SILENTREPORTS /etc/default/aide

    SILENTREPORTS=no

    If SILENTREPORTS is uncommented and set to yes, this is a finding.

    Configure the Ubuntu operating system to notify designated personnel if
