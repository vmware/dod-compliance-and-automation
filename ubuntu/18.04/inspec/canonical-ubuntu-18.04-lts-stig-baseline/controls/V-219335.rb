    Verify that kernel core dumps are disabled unless needed.

    Check if \"kdump\" service is active with the following command:

    # systemctl is-active kdump.service
    inactive

    If the \"kdump\" service is active, ask the System Administrator if the use
of the service is required and documented with the Information System Security
Officer (ISSO).

    If the service is active and is not documented, this is a finding.

  desc 'fix', "
    If kernel core dumps are not required, disable the \"kdump\" service with
the following command:

    # systemctl disable kdump.service

    If kernel core dumps are required, document the need with the Information
System Security Officer (ISSO).
