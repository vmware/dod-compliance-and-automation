    Verify that encrypted passwords stored in /etc/shadow use a strong
cryptographic hash.

    Check that pam_unix.so auth is configured to use sha512 with the following
command:

    # grep password /etc/pam.d/common-password | grep pam_unix

    password [success=1 default=ignore] pam_unix.so obscure sha512

    If \"sha512\" is not an option of the output, or is commented out, this is
a finding.

    Check that ENCRYPT_METHOD is set to sha512 in /etc/login.defs:

    # grep -i ENCRYPT_METHOD /etc/login.defs

    ENCRYPT_METHOD SHA512

    If the output does not contain \"sha512\", or it is commented out, this is
a finding.

    Configure the Ubuntu operating system to encrypt all stored passwords with
a strong cryptographic hash.

    Edit/modify the following line in the file \"/etc/pam.d/common-password\"
file to include the sha512 option for pam_unix.so:

    password [success=1 default=ignore] pam_unix.so obscure sha512

    Edit/modify /etc/login.defs and set \"ENCRYPT_METHOD sha512\".
