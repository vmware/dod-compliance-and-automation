    Verify the assigned home directory of all local interactive users is
group-owned by that user’s primary Group Identifier (GID).

    Check the home directory assignment for all non-privileged users on the
system with the following command:

    Note: This may miss local interactive users that have been assigned a
privileged UID. Evidence of interactive use may be obtained from a number of
log files containing system logon information. The returned directory
\"/home/smithj\" is used as an example.

    $ sudo ls -ld $(awk -F: '($3>=1000)&&($7 !~ /nologin/){print $6}'
/etc/passwd)

    drwxr-x--- 2 smithj admin 4096 Jun 5 12:41 smithj

    Check the user's primary group with the following command:

    $ sudo grep admin /etc/group
    admin:x:250:smithj,jonesj,jacksons

    If the user home directory referenced in \"/etc/passwd\" is not group-owned
by that user’s primary GID, this is a finding.

    Change the group owner of a local interactive user’s home directory to the
group found in \"/etc/passwd\". To change the group owner of a local
interactive user’s home directory, use the following command:

    Note: The example will be for the user \"smithj\", who has a home directory
of \"/home/smithj\", and has a primary group of users.

    $ sudo chgrp users /home/smithj
