  desc  "If audit information were to become compromised, then forensic
analysis and discovery of the true source of potentially malicious system
activity is impossible to achieve.

    To ensure the veracity of audit information, the operating system must
protect audit information from unauthorized modification.

    Verify that the audit log files have a mode of \"0600\" or less permissive.

    First determine where the audit logs are stored with the following command:

    # sudo grep -iw log_file /etc/audit/auditd.conf
    log_file = /var/log/audit/audit.log

    Using the path of the directory containing the audit logs, check if the
audit log files have a mode of \"0600\" or less by using the following command:

    # sudo stat -c \"%n %a\" /var/log/audit/*
    /var/log/audit/audit.log 600

    If the audit log files have a mode more permissive than \"0600\", this is a
finding.

    Configure the audit log files to have a mode of \"0600\" or less permissive.

    First determine where the audit logs are stored with the following command:

    # sudo grep -iw log_file /etc/audit/auditd.conf
    log_file = /var/log/audit/audit.log

    Using the path of the directory containing the audit logs, configure the
audit log files to have a mode of \"0600\" or less permissive by using the
following command:

    # sudo chmod 0600 /var/log/audit/*
