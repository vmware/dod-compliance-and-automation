  title "The Ubuntu operating system must display the Standard Mandatory DoD
Notice and Consent Banner before granting local access to the system via a
graphical user logon."
  desc  "The banner must be acknowledged by the user prior to allowing the user
access to the operating system. This provides assurance that the user has seen
the message and accepted the conditions for access. If the consent banner is
not acknowledged by the user, DoD will not be in compliance with system use
notifications required by law.

    To establish acceptance of the application usage policy, a click-through
banner at system logon is required. The system must prevent further activity
until the user executes a positive action to manifest agreement by clicking on
a box indicating \"OK\".

    Verify the Ubuntu operating system displays the Standard Mandatory DoD
Notice and Consent Banner before granting access to the operating system via a
graphical user logon.
    Note: If the system does not have Graphical User Interface installed, this
requirement is Not Applicable.

    Check that the operating system displays the exact approved Standard
Mandatory DoD Notice and Consent Banner text with the command:

    # grep banner-message-enable /etc/gdm3/greeter.dconf-defaults

    banner-message-enable=true

    If the line is commented out or set to \"false\", this is a finding.

    # grep banner-message-text /etc/gdm3/greeter.dconf-defaults

    banner-message-text=\"You are accessing a U.S. Government \\(USG\\)

    If the banner-message-text is missing, commented out, or the text does not
match the Standard Mandatory DoD Notice and Consent Banner exactly, this is a
finding.

    Edit the /etc/gdm3/greeter.dconf-defaults file.

    Uncomment (remove the leading '#' characters) the following 3 configuration
lines:

    [org/gnome/login-screen]

    banner-message-enable=true
    banner-message-text='Welcome'

    Note: the lines are all near the bottom of the file but they are not
adjacent to each other.

    Edit the banner-message-text='Welcome' line to contain the appropriate
banner message text as shown below:

    banner-message-text='You are accessing a U.S. Government (USG) Information
