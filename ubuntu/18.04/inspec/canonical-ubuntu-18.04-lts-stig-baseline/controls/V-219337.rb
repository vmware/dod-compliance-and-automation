  desc  "Remote access services, such as those providing remote access to
network devices and information systems, which lack automated control
capabilities, increase risk and make remote user access management difficult at
best.

    Remote access is access to DoD nonpublic information systems by an
authorized user (or an information system) communicating through an external,
non-organization-controlled network. Remote access methods include, for
example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless.

    Ubuntu operating system functionality (e.g., RDP) must be capable of taking
enforcement action if the audit reveals unauthorized activity. Automated
control of remote access sessions allows organizations to ensure ongoing
compliance with remote access policies by enforcing connection rules of remote
access applications on a variety of information system components (e.g.,
servers, workstations, notebook computers, smartphones, and tablets).

    Verify the Uncomplicated Firewall is enabled on the system by running the
following command:

    # systemctl is-enabled ufw

    If the above command returns the status as \"disabled\", this is a finding.

    Verify the Uncomplicated Firewall is active on the system by running the
following command:

    # sudo systemctl is-active ufw

    If the above command returns 'inactive' or any kind of error, this is a
finding.

    If the Uncomplicated Firewall is not installed ask the System Administrator
if another application firewall is installed.

    If no application firewall is installed this is a finding.

    Enable the Uncomplicated Firewall by using the following command:

    # sudo systemctl enable ufw.service

    If the Uncomplicated Firewall is not currently running on the system, start
