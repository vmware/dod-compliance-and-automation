  desc  "If audit information were to become compromised, then forensic
analysis and discovery of the true source of potentially malicious system
activity is impossible to achieve.

    To ensure the veracity of audit information, the operating system must
protect audit information from unauthorized deletion. This requirement can be
achieved through multiple methods, which will depend upon system architecture
and design.

    Audit information includes all information (e.g., audit records, audit
settings, audit reports) needed to successfully audit information system
activity.

    Verify that the audit log directory has a mode of \"0750\" or less
permissive.

    First determine where the audit logs are stored with the following command:

    # sudo grep -iw log_file /etc/audit/auditd.conf
    log_file = /var/log/audit/audit.log

    Using the path of the directory containing the audit logs, check if the
directory has a mode of \"0750\" or less by using the following command:

    # sudo stat -c \"%n %a\" /var/log/audit
    /var/log/audit 750

    If the audit log directory has a mode more permissive than \"0750\", this
is a finding.

    Configure the audit log directory to have a mode of \"0750\" or less
permissive.

    First determine where the audit logs are stored with the following command:

    # sudo grep -iw log_file /etc/audit/auditd.conf

    Using the path of the directory containing the audit logs, configure the
audit log directory to have a mode of \"0750\" or less permissive by using the
following command:

    # chmod -R g-w,o-rwx /var/log/audit
