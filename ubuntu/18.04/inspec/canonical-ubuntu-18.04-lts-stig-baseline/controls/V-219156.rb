    Verify Advance package Tool (APT) is configured to remove all software
components after updated versions have been installed.

    Check that APT is configured to remove all software components after
updating with the following command:

    # grep -i remove-unused /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades
    Unattended-Upgrade::Remove-Unused-Dependencies \"true\";
    Unattended-Upgrade::Remove-Unused-Kernel-Packages \"true\";

    If the \"::Remove-Unused-Dependencies\" and
\"::Remove-Unused-Kernel-Packages\" parameters are not set to \"true\", or are
missing, or are commented out, this is a finding.

  desc 'fix', "
    Configure APT to remove all software components after updated versions have

\"/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades\" file:

    Unattended-Upgrade::Remove-Unused-Dependencies \"true\";
    Unattended-Upgrade::Remove-Unused-Kernel-Packages \"true\";
