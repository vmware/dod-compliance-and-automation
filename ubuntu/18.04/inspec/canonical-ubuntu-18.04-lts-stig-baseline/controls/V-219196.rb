  desc  "Protecting audit information also includes identifying and protecting
the tools used to view and manipulate log data. Therefore, protecting audit
tools is necessary to prevent unauthorized operation on audit information.

    The Ubuntu operating system providing tools to interface with audit
information will leverage user permissions and roles identifying the user
accessing the tools and the corresponding rights the user enjoys in order to
make access decisions regarding the access to audit tools.

    Audit tools include, but are not limited to, vendor-provided and open
source audit tools needed to successfully view and manipulate audit information
system activity and records. Audit tools include custom queries and report
generators.

    Verify the Ubuntu operating system configures the audit tools to be owned
by root to prevent any unauthorized access, deletion, or modification.

    For each audit tool,
    /sbin/auditctl, /sbin/aureport, /sbin/ausearch, /sbin/autrace,
/sbin/auditd, /sbin/audispd, /sbin/augenrules

    Check the ownership by running the following command:

    # stat -c \"%n %U\" /sbin/auditctl

    /sbin/auditctl root

    If any of the audit tools are not owned by root, this is a finding.
  "
  desc 'fix', "
    Configure the audit tools on the Ubuntu operating system to be owned by
root, by running the following command:

    # sudo chown root [audit_tool]

    Replace \"[audit_tool]\" with each audit tool not owned by root.
