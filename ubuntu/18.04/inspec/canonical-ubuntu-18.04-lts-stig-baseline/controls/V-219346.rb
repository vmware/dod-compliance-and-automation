  title "The Ubuntu operating system must disable all wireless network
adapters."
  desc  "Without protection of communications with wireless peripherals,
confidentiality and integrity may be compromised because unprotected
communications can be intercepted and either read, altered, or used to
compromise the operating system.

    This requirement applies to wireless peripheral technologies (e.g.,
wireless mice, keyboards, displays, etc.) used with an operating system.
Wireless peripherals (e.g., Wi-Fi/Bluetooth/IR Keyboards, Mice, and Pointing
Devices and Near Field Communications [NFC]) present a unique challenge by
creating an open, unsecured port on a computer. Wireless peripherals must meet
DoD requirements for wireless data transmission and be approved for use by the
AO. Even though some wireless peripherals, such as mice and pointing devices,
do not ordinarily carry information that need to be protected, modification of
communications with these wireless peripherals may be used to compromise the
operating system. Communication paths outside the physical protection of a
controlled boundary are exposed to the possibility of interception and
modification.

    Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of communications with
wireless peripherals can be accomplished by physical means (e.g., employing
physical barriers to wireless radio frequencies) or by logical means (e.g.,
employing cryptographic techniques). If physical means of protection are
employed, then logical means (cryptography) do not have to be employed, and
vice versa. If the wireless peripheral is only passing telemetry data,
encryption of the data may not be required.

    Verify that there are no wireless interfaces configured on the system.

    Check that the system does not have active wireless interfaces with the
following command:

    Note: This requirement is Not Applicable for systems that do not have
physical wireless network radios.
