sequence if a graphical user interface is installed."
  desc  "A locally logged-on user who presses Ctrl-Alt-Delete, when at the
console, can reboot the system. If accidentally pressed, as could happen in the
case of a mixed OS environment, this can create the risk of short-term loss of
availability of systems due to unintentional reboot. In the graphical
environment, risk of unintentional reboot from the Ctrl-Alt-Delete sequence is
reduced because the user will be prompted before any action is taken."

    Verify the Ubuntu operating system is not configured to reboot the system
when Ctrl-Alt-Delete is pressed when using a graphical user interface.

    Check that the \"logout\" target is not bound to an action with the
following command:

    # grep logout /etc/dconf/db/local.d/*

    logout=''

    If the \"logout\" key is bound to an action, is commented out, or is
missing, this is a finding.

    Configure the system to disable the Ctrl-Alt-Delete sequence when using a
graphical user interface by creating or editing the
/etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-disable-CAD file.

    Add the setting to disable the Ctrl-Alt-Delete sequence for the graphical
user interface:

    [org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys]
    logout=''

    Then update the dconf settings:

    # dconf update
