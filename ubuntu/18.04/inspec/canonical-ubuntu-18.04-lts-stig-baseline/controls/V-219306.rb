  title 'The Ubuntu operating system must monitor remote access methods.'
  desc  "Remote access services, such as those providing remote access to
network devices and information systems, which lack automated monitoring
capabilities, increase risk and make remote user access management difficult at
best.

    Remote access is access to DoD nonpublic information systems by an
authorized user (or an information system) communicating through an external,
non-organization-controlled network. Remote access methods include, for
example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless.

    Automated monitoring of remote access sessions allows organizations to
detect cyber attacks and also ensure ongoing compliance with remote access
policies by auditing connection activities of remote access capabilities, such
as Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), on a variety of information system components
(e.g., servers, workstations, notebook computers, smartphones, and tablets).

    Verify that the Ubuntu operating system monitors all remote access methods.

    Check that remote access methods are being logged by running the following
command:

    # grep -E -r '^(auth,authpriv\\.\\*|daemon\\.\\*)' /etc/rsyslog.*
    /etc/rsyslog.d/50-default.conf:auth,authpriv.* /var/log/auth.log
    /etc/rsyslog.d/50-default.conf:daemon.notice /var/log/messages

    If \"auth.*\", \"authpriv.*\" or \"daemon.*\" are not configured to be
logged in at least one of the config files, this is a finding.
  "
  desc 'fix', "
    Configure the Ubuntu operating system to monitor all remote access methods
by adding the following lines to the \"/etc/rsyslog.d/50-default.conf\" file:

    auth.*,authpriv.* /var/log/secure
    daemon.notice /var/log/messages

    In order for the changes to take effect the \"rsyslog\" service must be
restarted with the following command:

    # sudo systemctl restart rsyslog.service
