  title "The Ubuntu operating system must configure the SSH daemon to only use
Message Authentication Codes (MACs) employing FIPS 140-2 approved cryptographic

communications."
  desc  "Without cryptographic integrity protections, information can be
altered by unauthorized users without detection.

    Nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities are those activities
conducted by individuals communicating through a network, either an external
network (e.g., the Internet) or an internal network. Local maintenance and
diagnostic activities are those activities carried out by individuals
physically present at the information system or information system component
and not communicating across a network connection.

    Remote access (e.g., RDP) is access to DoD nonpublic information systems by
an authorized user (or an information system) communicating through an
external, non-organization-controlled network. Remote access methods include,
for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless.

    Cryptographic mechanisms used for protecting the integrity of information
include, for example, signed hash functions using asymmetric cryptography
enabling distribution of the public key to verify the hash information while
maintaining the confidentiality of the secret key used to generate the hash.

    Verify the Ubuntu operating system configures the SSH daemon to only use
Message Authentication Codes (MACs) that employ FIPS 140-2 approved ciphers.

    Check that the SSH daemon is configured to only use MACs that employ FIPS
140-2 approved ciphers with the following command:

    # sudo grep -i macs /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    MACs hmac-sha2-256,hmac-sha2-512

    If any ciphers other than \"hmac-sha2-256\" or \"hmac-sha2-512\" are listed
or the returned line is commented out, this is a finding.
  "
  desc 'fix', "
    Configure the Ubuntu operating system to allow the SSH daemon to only use
Message Authentication Codes (MACs) that employ FIPS 140-2 approved ciphers.

    Edit the \"/etc/ssh/sshd_config\" file to uncomment or add the line for the
\"MACs\" keyword and set its value to \"hmac-sha2-256\" and/or
\"hmac-sha2-512\":

    MACs hmac-sha2-256,hmac-sha2-512

    In order for the changes to take effect, reload the SSH daemon.

    # sudo systemctl reload sshd.service
