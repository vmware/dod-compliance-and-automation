    Verify the Ubuntu operating system configures the /var/log directory to be
owned by root.

    Check that the /var/log directory is owned by root with the following
command:

    # sudo stat -c \"%n %U\" /var/log
    /var/log root

    If the /var/log directory is not owned by root, this is a finding.
