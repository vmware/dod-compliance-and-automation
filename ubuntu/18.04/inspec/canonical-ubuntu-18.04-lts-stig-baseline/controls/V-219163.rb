    If smart card authentication is not being used on the system this item is
Not Applicable.

    Verify that Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) prohibits the use of
cached authentications after one day.

    Check that PAM prohibits the use of cached authentications after one day
with the following command:

    # sudo grep offline_credentials_expiration /etc/sssd/sssd.conf
/etc/sssd/conf.d/*.conf

    offline_credentials_expiration = 1

    If \"offline_credentials_expiration\" is not set to a value of \"1\", in
/etc/sssd/sssd.conf or in a file with a name ending in .conf in the
/etc/sssd/conf.d/ directory, this is a finding.

  desc 'fix', "
    Configure Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) to prohibit the use of
cached authentications after one day. Add or change the following line in
\"/etc/sssd/sssd.conf\" just below the line \"[pam]\".

    offline_credentials_expiration = 1

    Note: It is valid for this configuration to be in a file with a name that
ends with \".conf\" and does not begin with a \".\" in the /etc/sssd/conf.d/
directory instead of the /etc/sssd/sssd.conf file.
