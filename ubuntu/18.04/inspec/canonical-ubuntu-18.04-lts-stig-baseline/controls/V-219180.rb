    Verify that the Ubuntu operating system prevents passwords from being
reused for a minimum of five generations by running the following command:

    # grep -i remember /etc/pam.d/common-password

    password [success=1 default=ignore] pam_unix.so sha512 shadow remember=5

    If the \"remember\" parameter value is not greater than or equal to 5,
commented out, or not set at all this is a finding.

    Configure the Ubuntu operating system prevents passwords from being reused
for a minimum of five generations.

    Add, or modify the \"remember\" parameter value to the following line in
\"/etc/pam.d/common-password\" file:
