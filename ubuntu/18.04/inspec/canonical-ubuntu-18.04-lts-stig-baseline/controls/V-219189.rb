    Verify the Ubuntu operating system configures the /var/log directory to be
group-owned by syslog.

    Check that the /var/log directory is group owned by syslog with the
following command:

    # sudo stat -c \"%n %G\" /var/log
    /var/log syslog

    If the /var/log directory is not group-owned by syslog, this is a finding.
