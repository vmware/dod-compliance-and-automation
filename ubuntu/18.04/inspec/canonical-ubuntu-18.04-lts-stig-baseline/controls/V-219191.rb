    Verify that the Ubuntu operating system configures the /var/log directory
with a mode of 750 or less permissive.

    Check the mode of the /var/log directory with the following command:

    # stat -c \"%n %a\" /var/log

    /var/log 750

    If a value of \"750\" or less permissive is not returned, this is a finding.
