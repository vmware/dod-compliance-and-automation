non-executable regions of memory or in memory locations that are prohibited.
Security safeguards employed to protect memory include, for example, data

prevention safeguards can either be hardware-enforced or software-enforced with
hardware providing the greater strength of mechanism.

    Examples of attacks are buffer overflow attacks.

    Verify the Ubuntu operating system implements address space layout
randomization (ASLR).

    Check that ASLR is configured on the system with the following command:

    # sudo sysctl kernel.randomize_va_space

    kernel.randomize_va_space = 2

    Verify the kernel parameter \"randomize_va_space\" is set to 2 with the
following command:

    # cat /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space

    2

    If \"kernel.randomize_va_space\" is not set to 2, this is a finding.

    Check the saved value of the kernel.randomize_va_space variable is not
different from 2.

    # sudo egrep -R \"^kernel.randomize_va_space=[^2]\" /etc/sysctl.conf
/etc/sysctl.d

    If this returns a result, this is a finding.
  "
  desc  'fix', "
    Set the \"kernel.randomize_va_space\" entry found in the
\"/etc/sysctl.conf\" file to a value of \"2\".

    After the line has been modified the kernel settings from all system
configuration files must be reloaded; before any of the changes will take
effect.

    Run the following command to reload all of the kernel system configuration
files:

    # sudo sysctl --system
