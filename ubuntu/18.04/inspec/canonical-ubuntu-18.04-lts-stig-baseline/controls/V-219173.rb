  desc  "Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources
required to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a
measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing
and brute-force attacks.

    Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it
takes to crack a password. The more complex the password, the greater the
number of possible combinations that need to be tested before the password is
compromised.

    Verify the Ubuntu operating system enforces password complexity by
requiring that at least one lower-case character be used.

    Determine if the field \"lcredit\" is set in the
\"/etc/security/pwquality.conf\" file with the following command:

    # grep -i \"lcredit\" /etc/security/pwquality.conf
    lcredit=-1

    If the \"lcredit\" parameter is greater than \"-1\", or is commented out,
this is a finding.
  "
  desc  'fix', "
    Add or update the \"/etc/security/pwquality.conf\" file to contain the
\"lcredit\" parameter:

    lcredit=-1
