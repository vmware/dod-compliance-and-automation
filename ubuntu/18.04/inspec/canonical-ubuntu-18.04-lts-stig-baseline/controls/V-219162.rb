    Verify the audit event multiplexor is configured to off-load audit records
to a different system or storage media from the system being audited.

    Check that audisp-remote plugin is installed:

    # sudo dpkg -s audispd-plugins

    If status is \"not installed\", verify that another method to off-load
audit logs has been implemented.

    Check that the records are being off-loaded to a remote server with the
following command:

    # sudo grep -i active /etc/audisp/plugins.d/au-remote.conf

    active = yes

    If \"active\" is not set to \"yes\", or the line is commented out, ask the
System Administrator to indicate how the audit logs are off-loaded to a
different system or storage media.

    If there is no evidence that the system is configured to off-load audit
logs to a different system or storage media, this is a finding.

    Configure the audit event multiplexor to off-load audit records to a
different system or storage media from the system being audited.

    Install the audisp-remote plugin:

    # sudo apt-get install audispd-plugins -y

    Set the audisp-remote plugin as active, by editing the
/etc/audisp/plugins.d/au-remote.conf file:

    # sudo sed -i -E 's/active\\s*=\\s*no/active = yes/'
/etc/audisp/plugins.d/au-remote.conf

    Set the address of the remote machine, by editing the
/etc/audisp/audisp-remote.conf file:

    # sudo sed -i -E 's/(remote_server\\s*=).*/\\1 <remote addr>/'
audisp-remote.conf

    where <remote addr> must be substituted by the address of the remote server
receiving the audit log.

    Make the audit service reload its configuration files:

    # sudo systemctl restart auditd.service
