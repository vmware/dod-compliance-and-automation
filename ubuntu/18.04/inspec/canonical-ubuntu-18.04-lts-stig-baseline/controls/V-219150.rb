protections must employ cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized
disclosure and modification of the information at rest."
  desc  "Information at rest refers to the state of information when it is
located on a secondary storage device (e.g., disk drive and tape drive, when
used for backups) within an operating system.

    This requirement addresses protection of user-generated data, as well as
Ubuntu operating system-specific configuration data. Organizations may choose
to employ different mechanisms to achieve confidentiality and integrity
protections, as appropriate, in accordance with the security category and/or
classification of the information.

    If there is a documented and approved reason for not having data-at-rest
encryption, this requirement is Not Applicable.

    Verify the Ubuntu operating system prevents unauthorized disclosure or
modification of all information requiring at rest protection by using disk
encryption.

    Determine the partition layout for the system with the following command:

    #sudo fdisk -l
    (..)
    Disk /dev/vda: 15 GiB, 16106127360 bytes, 31457280 sectors
    Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
    Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
    I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
    Disklabel type: gpt
    Disk identifier: 83298450-B4E3-4B19-A9E4-7DF147A5FEFB

    Device Start End Sectors Size Type
    /dev/vda1 2048 4095 2048 1M BIOS boot
    /dev/vda2 4096 2101247 2097152 1G Linux filesystem
    /dev/vda3 2101248 31455231 29353984 14G Linux filesystem
    (...)

    Verify that the system partitions are all encrypted with the following
command:

    # more /etc/crypttab

    Every persistent disk partition present must have an entry in the file. If
any partitions other than the boot partition or pseudo file systems (such as
/proc or /sys) are not listed, this is a finding.
  "
  desc 'fix', "
    To encrypt an entire partition, dedicate a partition for encryption in the
partition layout.

    Note: Encrypting a partition in an already-installed system is more
difficult because the existing partitions must be resized and changed.
