greater than one second."
  desc  "Inaccurate time stamps make it more difficult to correlate events and
can lead to an inaccurate analysis. Determining the correct time a particular
event occurred on a system is critical when conducting forensic analysis and
investigating system events.

    Synchronizing internal information system clocks provides uniformity of
time stamps for information systems with multiple system clocks and systems
connected over a network. Organizations should consider setting time periods
for different types of systems (e.g., financial, legal, or mission-critical
systems).

    Organizations should also consider endpoints that may not have regular
access to the authoritative time server (e.g., mobile, teleworking, and
tactical endpoints). This requirement is related to the comparison done every
24 hours in SRG-OS-000355 because a comparison must be done in order to
determine the time difference.

    Verify the operating system synchronizes internal system clocks to the
authoritative time source when the time difference is greater than one second.

    Check the value of \"makestep\" by running the following command:

    # sudo grep makestep /etc/chrony/chrony.conf

    makestep 1 -1

    If the makestep option is commented out or is not set to \"1 -1\", this is
a finding.

  desc 'fix', "
    Configure chrony to synchronize the internal system clocks to the
authoritative source when the time difference is greater than one second by
doing the following,

    Edit the /etc/chrony/chrony.conf file and add:

    makestep 1 -1

    Restart the chrony service,

    # sudo systemctl restart chrony.service
