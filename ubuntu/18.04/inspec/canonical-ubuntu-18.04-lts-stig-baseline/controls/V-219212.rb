    Verify the Ubuntu operating system is not configured to reboot the system
when Ctrl-Alt-Delete is pressed.

    Check that the \"ctrl-alt-del.target\" (otherwise also known as
reboot.target) is not active with the following command:

    # systemctl status ctrl-alt-del.target
    reboot.target - Reboot
     Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/reboot.target; disabled)
     Active: inactive (dead)
     Docs: man:systemd.special(7)

    If the \"ctrl-alt-del.target\" is active, this is a finding.

  desc 'fix', "
    Configure the system to disable the Ctrl-Alt-Delete sequence for the
command line with the following command:

    # sudo systemctl mask ctrl-alt-del.target

    And reload the daemon to take effect

    # sudo systemctl daemon-reload
