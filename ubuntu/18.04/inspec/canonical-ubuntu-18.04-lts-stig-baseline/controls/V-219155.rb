    Accordingly, patches, service packs, device drivers, or Ubuntu operating
system components must be signed with a certificate recognized and approved by
the organization.

    Verifying the authenticity of the software prior to installation validates
the integrity of the patch or upgrade received from a vendor. This ensures the
software has not been tampered with and that it has been provided by a trusted
vendor. Self-signed certificates are disallowed by this requirement. The Ubuntu
operating system should not have to verify the software again. This requirement
does not mandate DoD certificates for this purpose; however, the certificate
used to verify the software must be from an approved CA.

    Verify that Advance package Tool (APT) is configured to prevent the
installation of patches, service packs, device drivers, or Ubuntu operating
system components without verification they have been digitally signed using a
certificate that is recognized and approved by the organization.

    Check that the \"AllowUnauthenticated\" variable is not set at all or set
to \"false\" with the following command:

    # grep AllowUnauthenticated /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/*
    /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/01-vendor-Ubuntu:APT::Get::AllowUnauthenticated
\"false\";

    If any of the files returned from the command with \"AllowUnauthenticated\"
set to \"true\", this is a finding.
