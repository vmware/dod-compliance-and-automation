  title "The Ubuntu operating system must be configured so that three
consecutive invalid logon attempts by a user automatically locks the account
until released by an administrator."

unauthorized system access via user password guessing, otherwise known as

    Check that Ubuntu operating system locks an account after three
unsuccessful login attempts with following command:

    # grep pam_tally2 /etc/pam.d/common-auth

    auth required pam_tally2.so onerr=fail deny=3

    If no line is returned or the line is commented out, this is a finding.
    If the line is missing \"onerr=fail\", this is a finding.
    If the line has \"deny\" set to a value more than 3, this is a finding.

    Configure the Ubuntu operating system to lock an account after three
unsuccessful login attempts.

    Edit the /etc/pam.d/common-auth file. The pam_tally2.so entry must be
placed at the top of the \"auth\" stack. So add the following line before the
first \"auth\" entry in the file.

    auth required pam_tally2.so onerr=fail deny=3
