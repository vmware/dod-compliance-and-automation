  desc  "In order to prevent unauthorized connection of devices, unauthorized
transfer of information, or unauthorized tunneling (i.e., embedding of data
types within data types), organizations must disable or restrict unused or
unnecessary physical and logical ports/protocols on information systems.

    The Ubuntu operating system is capable of providing a wide variety of
functions and services. Some of the functions and services provided by default
may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations.
Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from a
single component (e.g., VPN and IPS); however, doing so increases risk over
limiting the services provided by any one component.

    To support the requirements and principles of least functionality, the
Ubuntu operating system must support the organizational requirements, providing
only essential capabilities and limiting the use of ports, protocols, and/or
services to only those required, authorized, and approved to conduct official
business or to address authorized quality of life issues.

    Verify the Ubuntu operating system is configured to prohibit or restrict
the use of functions, ports, protocols, and/or services as defined in the
Ports, Protocols, and Services Management (PPSM) Category Assignments List
(CAL) and vulnerability assessments.

    Check the firewall configuration for any unnecessary or prohibited
functions, ports, protocols, and/or services by running the following command:

    # sudo ufw show raw

    Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)
    target prot opt sources destination
    Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT 1 packets, 40 bytes)
     pkts bytes target prot opt in out source destination

    Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes)
     pkts bytes target prot opt in out source destination

    Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes)
     pkts bytes target prot opt in out source destination

    Ask the system administrator for the site or program PPSM CLSA. Verify the
services allowed by the firewall match the PPSM Component Local Services
Assessment (CLSA).

    If there are any additional ports, protocols, or services that are not
included in the PPSM CLSA, this is a finding.

    If there are any ports, protocols, or services that are prohibited by the
PPSM CAL, this is a finding.
  "
  desc  'fix', "
    Add all ports, protocols or services allowed by the PPSM CLSA by using the
following command:

    # ufw allow <direction> <port/protocol/service>

    where the direction is 'in' or 'out' and the port is the one corresponding
to the protocol or service allowed.

    To deny access to port, protocols or services, use:

    # ufw deny <direction> <port/protocol/service>
