    Verify that the Ubuntu operating system configures the /var/log/syslog file
to be group-owned by adm.

    Check that the /var/log/syslog file is group-owned by adm with the
following command:

    # sudo stat -c \"%n %G\" /var/log/syslog
    /var/log/syslog adm

    If the /var/log/syslog file is not group-owned by adm, this is a finding.
