  title "The Ubuntu operating system must generate error messages that provide
information necessary for corrective actions without revealing information that
could be exploited by adversaries."
  desc  "Any operating system providing too much information in error messages
risks compromising the data and security of the structure, and content of error
messages needs to be carefully considered by the organization.

    Organizations carefully consider the structure/content of error messages.
The extent to which information systems are able to identify and handle error
conditions is guided by organizational policy and operational requirements.
Information that could be exploited by adversaries includes, for example,
erroneous logon attempts with passwords entered by mistake as the username,
mission/business information that can be derived from (if not stated explicitly
by) information recorded, and personal information, such as account numbers,
social security numbers, and credit card numbers.
