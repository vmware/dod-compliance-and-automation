moves away from the immediate physical vicinity of the information system but
does not want to log out because of the temporary nature of the absence.

    The session lock is implemented at the point where session activity can be
determined. Rather than be forced to wait for a period of time to expire before
the user session can be locked, the Ubuntu operating system need to provide
users with the ability to manually invoke a session lock so users may secure
their session should the need arise for them to temporarily vacate the
immediate physical vicinity.
