    Verify the Ubuntu operating system enforces a delay of at least 4 seconds
between logon prompts following a failed logon attempt.

    Check that the Ubuntu operating system enforces a delay of at least 4
seconds between logon prompts with the following command:

    # grep pam_faildelay /etc/pam.d/common-auth

    auth required pam_faildelay.so delay=4000000

    If the line is not present, or is commented out, this is a finding.
