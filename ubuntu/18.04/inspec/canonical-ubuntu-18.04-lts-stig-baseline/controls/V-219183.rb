  desc  "Without providing this capability, an account may be created without a
password. Non-repudiation cannot be guaranteed once an account is created if a
user is not forced to change the temporary password upon initial logon.

    Temporary passwords are typically used to allow access when new accounts
are created or passwords are changed. It is common practice for administrators
to create temporary passwords for user accounts which allow the users to log
on, yet force them to change the password once they have successfully
authenticated.

    # chage -d 0 [UserName]
