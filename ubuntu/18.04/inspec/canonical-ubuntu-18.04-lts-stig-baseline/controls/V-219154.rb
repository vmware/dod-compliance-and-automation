    Verify there is a script which off-loads audit data and if that script runs
weekly.

    Check if there is a script in the /etc/cron.weekly directory which
off-loads audit data:

    # sudo ls /etc/cron.weekly

    audit-offload

    Check if the script inside the file does offloading of audit logs to an
external media.

    If the script file does not exist or if the script file doesn't offload
audit logs, this is a finding.
  "
  desc 'fix', "
    Create a script which off-loads audit logs to external media and runs
weekly.

    Script must be located into the /etc/cron.weekly directory.
