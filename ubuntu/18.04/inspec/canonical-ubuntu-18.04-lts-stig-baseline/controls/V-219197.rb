the tools used to view and manipulate log data. Therefore, protecting audit
tools is necessary to prevent unauthorized operation on audit information.

    The Ubuntu operating system providing tools to interface with audit
information will leverage user permissions and roles identifying the user
accessing the tools and the corresponding rights the user enjoys in order to
make access decisions regarding the access to audit tools.

    Audit tools include, but are not limited to, vendor-provided and open
source audit tools needed to successfully view and manipulate audit information
system activity and records. Audit tools include custom queries and report
generators.

    Verify the Ubuntu operating system configures the audit tools to be
group-owned by root to prevent any unauthorized access, deletion, or
modification.

    For each audit tools,
    /sbin/auditctl, /sbin/aureport, /sbin/ausearch, /sbin/autrace,
/sbin/auditd, /sbin/audispd, /sbin/augenrules

    Check the group-owner of each audit tool by running the following commands:

    stat -c \"%n %G\" /sbin/auditctl

    /sbin/auditctl root

    If any of the audit tools are not group-owned by root, this is a finding.

    Configure the audit tools on the Ubuntu operating system to be group-owned
by root, by running the following command:

    # sudo chgrp root [audit_tool]

    Replace \"[audit_tool]\" with each audit tool not group-owned by root.
