  title "The Ubuntu operating system must shut down by default upon audit
failure (unless availability is an overriding concern)."
  desc  "It is critical that when the Ubuntu operating system is at risk of
failing to process audit logs as required, it takes action to mitigate the
failure. Audit processing failures include: software/hardware errors; failures
in the audit capturing mechanisms; and audit storage capacity being reached or
exceeded. Responses to audit failure depend upon the nature of the failure mode.

    When availability is an overriding concern, other approved actions in
response to an audit failure are as follows:

    1) If the failure was caused by the lack of audit record storage capacity,
the Ubuntu operating system must continue generating audit records if possible
(automatically restarting the audit service if necessary), overwriting the
oldest audit records in a first-in-first-out manner.

    2) If audit records are sent to a centralized collection server and
communication with this server is lost or the server fails, the Ubuntu
operating system must queue audit records locally until communication is
restored or until the audit records are retrieved manually. Upon restoration of
the connection to the centralized collection server, action should be taken to
synchronize the local audit data with the collection server.

    Verify the Ubuntu operating system takes the appropriate action when the
audit storage volume is full.

    Check that the Ubuntu operating system takes the appropriate action when
the audit storage volume is full with the following command:

    # sudo grep disk_full_action /etc/audit/auditd.conf

    disk_full_action = HALT

    If the value of the \"disk_full_action\" option is not \"SYSLOG\",
\"SINGLE\", or \"HALT\", or the line is commented out, this is a finding.
  "
  desc 'fix', "
    Configure the Ubuntu operating system to shut down by default upon audit
failure (unless availability is an overriding concern).

    Add or update the following line (depending on configuration
\"disk_full_action\" can be set to \"SYSLOG\", \"HALT\" or \"SINGLE\") in
\"/etc/audit/auditd.conf\" file:

    disk_full_action = HALT

    Restart the auditd service so the changes take effect:
    # sudo systemctl restart auditd.service
