    Verify the Ubuntu operating system has the 'libpam-pkcs11’ package
installed, by running the following command:

    # dpkg -l | grep libpam-pkcs11

    If \"libpam-pkcs11\" is not installed, this is a finding.

    Check if use_mappers is set to pwent in /etc/pam_pkcs11/pam_pkcs11.conf file
    # grep use_mappers /etc/pam_pkcs11/pam_pkcs11.conf
    use_mappers = pwent

    If ‘use_mappers’ is not found or is not set to pwent this is a finding.

    Install libpam-pkcs11 package on the system.

    Set use_mappers=pwent in /etc/pam_pkcs11/pam_pkcs11.conf

    If the system is missing an \"/etc/pam_pkcs11/\" directory and an
\"/etc/pam_pkcs11/pam_pkcs11.conf\", find an example to copy into place and
modify accordingly at
\"/usr/share/doc/libpam-pkcs11/examples/pam_pkcs11.conf.example.gz\".
