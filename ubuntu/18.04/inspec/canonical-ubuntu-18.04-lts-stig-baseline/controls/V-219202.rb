  desc  "If the Ubuntu operating system were to allow any user to make changes
to software libraries, then those changes might be implemented without
undergoing the appropriate testing and approvals that are part of a robust
change management process.

    This requirement applies to Ubuntu operating systems with software
libraries that are accessible and configurable, as in the case of interpreted
languages. Software libraries also include privileged programs which execute
with escalated privileges. Only qualified and authorized individuals must be
allowed to obtain access to information system components for purposes of
initiating changes, including upgrades and modifications.

    Verify the system-wide library files contained in the directories \"/lib\",
\"/lib64\" and \"/usr/lib\" are group-owned by root.

    Check that the system-wide library files are group-owned by root with the
following command:

    # sudo find /lib /usr/lib /lib64 ! -group root -type f -exec stat -c \"%n
%G\" '{}' \\;

    If any system wide shared library file is returned, this is a finding.
  "
  desc 'fix', "
    Configure the system library files to be protected from unauthorized
access. Run the following command:

    # sudo find /lib /usr/lib /lib64 ! -group root -type f -exec chgrp root
'{}' \\;
