  desc  "DoS is a condition when a resource is not available for legitimate
users. When this occurs, the organization either cannot accomplish its mission
or must operate at degraded capacity.

    This requirement addresses the configuration of the Ubuntu operating system
to mitigate the impact of DoS attacks that have occurred or are ongoing on
system availability. For each system, known and potential DoS attacks must be
identified and solutions for each type implemented. A variety of technologies
exist to limit or, in some cases, eliminate the effects of DoS attacks (e.g.,
limiting processes or establishing memory partitions). Employing increased
capacity and bandwidth, combined with service redundancy, may reduce the
susceptibility to some DoS attacks.

    Verify an application firewall is configured to rate limit any connection
to the system.

    Check that the Uncomplicated Firewall is configured to rate limit any
connection to the system with the following command:

    # sudo ufw show raw

    Chain ufw-user-input (1 references)
    pkts bytes target prot opt in out source destination
    0 0 ufw-user-limit all -- eth0 * 0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0
    ctstate NEW recent: UPDATE seconds: 30 hit_count: 6 name: DEFAULT side:
    source mask: 255.255.255.255

    0 0 ufw-user-limit-accept all -- eth0 * 0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0

    If any service is not rate limited by the Uncomplicated Firewall, this is a
finding.

  desc 'fix', "
    Configure the application firewall to protect against or limit the effects
of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks by ensuring the Ubuntu operating system is
implementing rate-limiting measures on impacted network interfaces.

    Run the following command replacing \"[service]\" with the service that
needs to be rate limited.

    # sudo ufw limit [service]

    Or rate-limiting can be done on an interface. An example of adding a
rate-limit on the eth0 interface:

    # sudo ufw limit in on eth0
