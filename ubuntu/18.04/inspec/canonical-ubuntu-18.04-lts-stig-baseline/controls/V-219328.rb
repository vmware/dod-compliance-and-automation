    Verify the Ubuntu operating system defines default permissions for all
authenticated users in such a way that the user can only read and modify their
own files.

    Check that the Ubuntu operating system defines default permissions for all
authenticated users with the following command:

    # grep -i \"umask\" /etc/login.defs

    UMASK 077

    If the \"UMASK\" variable is set to \"000\", this is a finding with the
severity raised to a CAT I.

    If the value of \"UMASK\" is not set to \"077\", \"UMASK\" is commented out
or \"UMASK\" is missing completely, this is a finding.

    Configure the system to define the default permissions for all
authenticated users in such a way that the user can only read and modify their
own files.

    Edit the \"UMASK\" parameter in the \"/etc/login.defs\" file to match the
example below:

    UMASK 077
