    Verify that the Ubuntu operating system configures the /var/log/syslog file

    Check the /var/log/syslog permissions by running the following command:

    # stat -c \"%n %a\" /var/log/syslog

    /var/log/syslog 640

    If a value of \"640\" or less permissive is not returned, this is a finding.
