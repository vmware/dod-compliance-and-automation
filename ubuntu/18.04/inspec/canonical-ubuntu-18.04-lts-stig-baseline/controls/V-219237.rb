  desc  "In order to ensure Ubuntu operating systems have sufficient storage

able to allocate audit record storage capacity.

    The task of allocating audit record storage capacity is usually performed
during initial installation of the Ubuntu operating system.

    Verify the Ubuntu operating system allocates audit record storage capacity
to store at least one week's worth of audit records when audit records are not
immediately sent to a central audit record storage facility.

    Determine which partition the audit records are being written to with the
following command:

    # sudo grep log_file /etc/audit/auditd.conf
    log_file = /var/log/audit/audit.log

    Check the size of the partition that audit records are written to (with the
example being /var/log/audit/) with the following command:

    # df –h /var/log/audit/
    /dev/sda2 24G 10.4G 13.6G 43% /var/log/audit

    If the audit records are not written to a partition made specifically for
audit records (/var/log/audit is a separate partition), determine the amount of
space being used by other files in the partition with the following command:

    #du –sh [audit_partition]
    1.8G /var/log/audit

    Note: The partition size needed to capture a week's worth of audit records
is based on the activity level of the system and the total storage capacity
available. In normal circumstances, 10.0 GB of storage space for audit records
will be sufficient.

    If the audit record partition is not allocated for sufficient storage
capacity, this is a finding.
  "
  desc 'fix', "
    Allocate enough storage capacity for at least one week's worth of audit
records when audit records are not immediately sent to a central audit record
storage facility.

    If audit records are stored on a partition made specifically for audit
records, use the \"parted\" program to resize the partition with sufficient
space to contain one week's worth of audit records.

    If audit records are not stored on a partition made specifically for audit
records, a new partition with sufficient amount of space will need be to be
created.

    Set the auditd server to point to the mount point where the audit records
must be located:

    # sudo sed -i -E 's@^(log_file\\s*=\\s*).*@\\1 <log mountpoint>/audit.log@'
/etc/audit/auditd.conf

    where <log mountpoint> is the aforementioned mount point.
