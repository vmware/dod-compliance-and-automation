# VMware Cloud Foundation 4.x STIG Documentation

## Overview
In the United States Department of Defense (DOD), Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs) provide technical, standards-based hardening guidance. Officially published STIGs are mandatory in the DOD and fill a crucial role in systems accreditation as part of the Risk Management Framework (RMF). VMware has worked with the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) to publish many STIGs over the years and will continue to do so. Until STIG content is officially published by DISA we want to make our submitted content available to the community. More information is available in the overview document provided in the download.

The only official reference for DISA STIGs, once approved and published, is the US Department of Defense web site at https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/

## Intended Audience
The audience for the VMware Cloud Foundation 4.x STIG and/or STIG Readiness Guides is VMware Cloud Foundation 4.x customers in the DOD needing to harden and accredit their vSphere environments. Other entities can use this guidance, however there are items that are specific to the DOD that will not be applicable to a non-DOD environment.  

There are many engineered data center & hybrid cloud infrastructure products that also work with and host vSphere deployments, such as Dell VxRail and HPE SimpliVity. If this is how you consume vSphere, you should check with your productâ€™s support for guidance first before implementing any hardening.
