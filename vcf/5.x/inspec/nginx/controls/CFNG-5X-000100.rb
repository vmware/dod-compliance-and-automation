  title 'The SDDC Manager NGINX service must protect against MIME sniffing.'
  desc  "
    MIME sniffing was, and still is, a technique used by some web browsers to examine the content of a particular asset. This is done for the purpose of determining an asset's file format. This technique is useful in the event that there is not enough metadata information present for a particular asset, thus leaving the possibility that the browser interprets the asset incorrectly.

    Although MIME sniffing can be useful to determine an asset's correct file format, it can also cause a security vulnerability. This vulnerability can be quite dangerous both for site owners as well as site visitors. This is because an attacker can leverage MIME sniffing to send an XSS (Cross Site Scripting) attack.

    At the command line, run the following command:

    # nginx -T 2>&1 | sed -n \"/^.*server\\s{/,/.*location\\s.*{/p\" | grep \"add_header X-Content-Type-Options\"

    Example result:

    add_header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff;
    add_header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff;

    There should be one result for each server defined in Nginx.

    If the \"X-Content-Type-Options\" header is not configured to \"nosniff\", this is a finding.

    Navigate to and open:

    The nginx.conf (/etc/nginx/nginx.conf by default) file.

    Add the following line in the server context for each server defined in Nginx:

    add_header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff;

    At the command line, run the following command:

    # nginx -s reload
