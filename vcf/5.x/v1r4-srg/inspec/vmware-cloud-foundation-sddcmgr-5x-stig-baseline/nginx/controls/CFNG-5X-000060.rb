  desc  "
    A web server can limit the ability of the web server being used in a DoS attack through several methods. The methods employed will depend upon the hosted applications and their resource needs for proper operation.

    An example setting that could be used to limit the ability of the web server being used in a DoS attack is bandwidth throttling.

    Verify a shared memory zone has been established in the http context to track requests per IP.

    At the command line, run the following command:

    # nginx -T 2>&1 | sed -n \"/^http\\s{/,/server\\s{/p\" | grep limit_req_zone --color=always | grep \"zone=api_traffic\"

    Example result:

    limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=api_traffic:10m rate=5000r/s;

    If the \"limit_req_zone\" option is not configured in the http context to limit requests per IP, this is a finding.

    Verify the server terminating ssl also has a limit_req statement in its server context.

    At the command line, run the following command:

    # nginx -T 2>&1 | sed -n '/\\sserver\\s{/{:a;N;/.*location/!ba;/.*listen.*ssl/p}' | grep limit_req

    Example result:

    limit_req zone=api_traffic burst=100 nodelay;

    If the \"limit_req\" option is not configured to limit requests per IP, this is a finding.

    Note: Per server or location limit_req directives are acceptable to modify limits based on application needs as long as they are not disabled.

    Navigate to and open:

    The nginx.conf (/etc/nginx/nginx.conf by default) file.

    Add the following or similar line in the http context:

    limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=api_traffic:10m rate=5000r/s;

    Add the following or similar line in the server context that is terminating ssl:

    limit_req zone=api_traffic burst=100 nodelay;

    At the command line, run the following command:

    # nginx -s reload
