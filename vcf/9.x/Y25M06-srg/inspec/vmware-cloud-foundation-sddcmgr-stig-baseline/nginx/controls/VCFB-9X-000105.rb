  title 'The VMware Cloud Foundation SDDC Manager NGINX server must enable Content Security Policy.'
  desc  'A Content Security Policy (CSP) requires careful tuning and precise definition of the policy. If enabled, CSP has significant impact on the way browsers render pages (e.g., inline JavaScript is disabled by default and must be explicitly allowed in the policy). CSP prevents a wide range of attacks, including cross-site scripting and other cross-site injections.'

    Verify a header is configured for Content Security Policy.

    View the running configuration by running the following command:

    # nginx -T 2>&1 | sed -n \"/^.*server\\s{/,/.*location\\s.*{/p\" | grep \"add_header Content-Security-Policy\"

    Example configuration:

    server {
      add_header Content-Security-Policy \"default-src 'self'\";
    }

    If a header is not configured to define a Content Security Policy header in the http, server, or location context, this is a finding.

    Note: There can be several add_header directives. These directives are inherited from the previous configuration level if and only if there are no add_header directives defined on the current level so care must be taken if add_header is defined at multiple levels to include headers configured at a higher level.
  "
  desc 'fix', "
    Navigate to and open:

    The nginx.conf (/etc/nginx/nginx.conf by default or the included file where the server is defined) file.

    Add a add_header directive, for example:

    add_header Content-Security-Policy \"default-src 'self'\";

    Note: This can be customized to fit the web server or application requirements.

    Reload the NGINX configuration by running the following command:

    # nginx -s reload

    Note: There can be several add_header directives. These directives are inherited from the previous configuration level if and only if there are no add_header directives defined on the current level so care must be taken if add_header is defined at multiple levels to include headers configured at a higher level.
