  title 'The VMware Cloud Foundation Operations for Networks Platform NGINX server must implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to protect the integrity of remote sessions of external server contexts.'
  desc  'HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) instructs web browsers to only use secure connections for all future requests when communicating with a web site. Doing so helps prevent SSL protocol attacks, SSL stripping, cookie hijacking, and other attempts to circumvent SSL protection.'
  desc  'rationale', ''
  desc  'check', "
    Verify a header is present to configure HSTS.

    View the running configuration by running the following command:

    # nginx -T 2>&1 | sed -n '/server\\s{/{:a;N;/.*location/!ba;/listen.*\\sssl/p}'

    Example configuration:

    server {
      add_header Strict-Transport-Security max-age=15768000;
    }

    or

    server {
       add_header Strict-Transport-Security \"max-age=31536000\" always;
    }

    If an HSTS header is not configured for all servers and locations with SSL enabled, this is a finding.

    Note: There can be several add_header directives. These directives are inherited from the previous configuration level if and only if there are no add_header directives defined on the current level so care must be taken if add_header is defined at multiple levels to include headers configured at a higher level.

  desc 'fix', "
    Navigate to and open:

    The nginx.conf (/etc/nginx/nginx.conf by default or the included file where the server is defined) file.

    Add a add_header directive, for example:

    add_header Strict-Transport-Security \"max-age=31536000\" always;

    Reload the NGINX configuration by running the following command:

    # nginx -s reload

    Note: There can be several add_header directives. These directives are inherited from the previous configuration level if and only if there are no add_header directives defined on the current level so care must be taken if add_header is defined at multiple levels to include headers configured at a higher level.
