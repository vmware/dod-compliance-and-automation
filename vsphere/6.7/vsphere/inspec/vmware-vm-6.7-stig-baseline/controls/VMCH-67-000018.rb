  desc  "When salting is enabled (Mem.ShareForceSalting=1 or 2) in order to
share a page between two virtual machines both salt and the content of the page
must be same. A salt value is a configurable advanced option for each virtual
machine. The salt values can be manually specified in the virtual machine's
advanced settings with the new option sched.mem.pshare.salt. If this option is
not present in the virtual machine's advanced settings, then the value of the
vc.uuid option is taken as the default value. Since the vc.uuid is unique to
each virtual machine, by default TPS happens only among the pages belonging to
a particular virtual machine (Intra-VM)."

Configuration. Verify the sched.mem.pshare.salt setting does not exist.

    From a PowerCLI command prompt while connected to the ESXi host or vCenter
server, run the following command:

    Get-VM \"VM Name\" | Get-AdvancedSetting -Name sched.mem.pshare.salt

Configuration. Delete the sched.mem.pshare.salt setting.

    Note: The VM must be powered off to configure the advanced settings through
the vSphere Web Client so it is recommended to configure these settings with
PowerCLI as it can be done while the VM is powered on. Settings do not take
effect via either method until the virtual machine is cold started, not
rebooted.
