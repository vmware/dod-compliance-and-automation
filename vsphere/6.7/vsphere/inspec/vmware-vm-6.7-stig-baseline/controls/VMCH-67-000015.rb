Configuration. Find the tools.setinfo.sizeLimit value and set it to 1048576. If
the setting does not exist, add the Name and Value setting at the bottom of
screen.

    Note: The VM must be powered off to configure the advanced settings through
the vSphere Web Client so it is recommended to configure these settings with
PowerCLI as it can be done while the VM is powered on. Settings do not take
effect via either method until the virtual machine is cold started, not
rebooted.

    From a PowerCLI command prompt while connected to the ESXi host or vCenter
server, run the following command:

    If the setting does not exist, run:

    Get-VM \"VM Name\" | New-AdvancedSetting -Name tools.setinfo.sizeLimit
-Value 1048576

    If the setting exists, run:

    Get-VM \"VM Name\" | Get-AdvancedSetting -Name tools.setinfo.sizeLimit |
