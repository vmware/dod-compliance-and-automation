    From the vSphere Web Client right-click the Virtual Machine and go to Edit
Settings. Review the VMs hardware and verify no parallel devices exist.

    From a PowerCLI command prompt while connected to the ESXi host or vCenter
server, run the following command:

    Get-VM | Where {$_.ExtensionData.Config.Hardware.Device.DeviceInfo.Label
