Edit Configuration. Find the \"mks.enable3d\" value and verify it is set to
\"false\".

    From a PowerCLI command prompt while connected to the ESXi host or vCenter
server, run the following command:

    Get-VM \"VM Name\" | Get-AdvancedSetting -Name mks.enable3d

    If the virtual machine advanced setting \"mks.enable3d\" does not exist or
is not set to \"false\", this is a finding.

    If a virtual machine requires 3D features, this is not a finding.

Configuration. Find the \"mks.enable3d\" value and set it to \"false\".

    Note: The VM must be powered off to modify the advanced settings through
the vSphere Web Client. It is recommended to configure these settings with
PowerCLI as this can be done while the VM is powered on. In this case, the
modified settings will not take effect until a cold boot of the VM.

    or

    From a PowerCLI command prompt while connected to the ESXi host or vCenter
server, run the following command:

    If the setting does not exist, run:

    Get-VM \"VM Name\" | New-AdvancedSetting -Name mks.enable3d -Value false

    If the setting exists, run:

    Get-VM \"VM Name\" | Get-AdvancedSetting -Name mks.enable3d |
Set-AdvancedSetting -Value false
