  desc  "vMotion migrations in vSphere 6.0 and earlier transferred working
memory and CPU state information in clear text over the vMotion network. As of
vSphere 6.5 this transfer can be transparently encryptedÂ using 256bit AES-GCM
with negligible performance impact. vSphere 6.5 enables encrypted vMotion by
default as \"Opportunistic\", meaning that encrypted channels are used where
supported but the operation will continue in plain text where encryption is not
supported. For example when vMotioning between two 6.5 hosts encryption will
always be utilized but since 6.0 and earlier releases do not support this
feature vMotion from a 6.5 host to a 6.0 host would be allowed but would not be
encrypted. If this finding is set to \"Required\" then vMotions to unsupported
hosts will fail. This setting must be set to \"Opportunistic\" or \"Required\"."

    Note: If the system does not have vCenter installed and utilizes vMotion,
then this is Not Applicable.

    From the vSphere Web Client, select the Virtual Machine, right-click and go
to Edit Settings >> VM Options Tab >> Encryption >> Encrypted vMotion.

    or

    From a PowerCLI command prompt while connected to the ESXi host or vCenter
server, run the following command:

    Get-VM | Where {($_.ExtensionData.Config.MigrateEncryption -ne
\"opportunistic\") -and ($_.ExtensionData.Config.MigrateEncryption -ne
\"required\")}

    If the setting does not have a value of \"Opportunistic\" or \"Required\",
this is a finding.
