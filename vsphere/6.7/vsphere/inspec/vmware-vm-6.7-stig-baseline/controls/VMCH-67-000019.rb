Configuration. Look for settings with the format ethernet*.filter*.name.

    Get-VM \"VM Name\" | Get-AdvancedSetting -Name \"ethernet*.filter*.name*\"

    If the virtual machine advanced setting ethernet*.filter*.name exists and
dvfilters are not in use, this is a finding.

    If the virtual machine advanced setting ethernet*.filter*.name exists and
the value is not valid, this is a finding.

Configuration. Look for settings with the format ethernet*.filter*.name. Ensure
only required VMs use this setting.

    Note: The VM must be powered off to configure the advanced settings through
the vSphere Web Client so it is recommended to configure these settings with
PowerCLI as it can be done while the VM is powered on. Settings do not take
effect via either method until the virtual machine is cold started, not
rebooted.

    Get-VM \"VM Name\" | Get-AdvancedSetting -Name ethernetX.filterY.name |
Remove-AdvancedSetting

    Note:  Change the X and Y values to match the specific setting in your
environment.
