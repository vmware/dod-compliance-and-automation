Configuration. Verify the isolation.tools.dnd.disable value is set to true. If
the setting does not exist, add the Name and Value setting at the bottom of

    Note: The VM must be powered off to configure the advanced settings through
the vSphere Web Client so it is recommended to configure these settings with
PowerCLI as it can be done while the VM is powered on. Settings do not take
effect via either method until the virtual machine is cold started, not
rebooted.

-Value true

    If the setting exists, run:

    Get-VM \"VM Name\" | Get-AdvancedSetting -Name isolation.tools.dnd.disable
