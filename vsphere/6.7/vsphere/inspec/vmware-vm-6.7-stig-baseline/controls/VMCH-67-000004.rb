  title 'Virtual disk shrinking must be disabled on the virtual machine.'
  desc  "Shrinking a virtual disk reclaims unused space in it. If there is
empty space in the disk, this process reduces the amount of space the virtual
disk occupies on the host drive. Normal users and processes-that is, users and
processes without root or administrator privileges-within virtual machines have
the capability to invoke this procedure. However, if this is done repeatedly,
the virtual disk can become unavailable while this shrinking is being
performed, effectively causing a denial-of-service. In most datacenter
environments, disk shrinking is not done, so this feature must be disabled.
Repeated disk shrinking can make a virtual disk unavailable. The capability to
shrink is available to non-administrative users operating within the VMs guest
OS."

    From the vSphere Web Client right-click the Virtual Machine and go to Edit
Settings >> VM Options >> Advanced >> Configuration Parameters >> Edit
Configuration. Verify the isolation.tools.diskShrink.disable value is set to
true.

    or

    From a PowerCLI command prompt while connected to the ESXi host or vCenter
server, run the following command:

    Get-VM \"VM Name\" | Get-AdvancedSetting -Name
isolation.tools.diskShrink.disable

    If the virtual machine advanced setting isolation.tools.diskShrink.disable
does not exist or is not set to true, this is a finding.

    From the vSphere Web Client right-click the Virtual Machine and go to Edit
Settings >> VM Options >> Advanced >> Configuration Parameters >> Edit
Configuration. Find the isolation.tools.diskShrink.disable value and set it to
true. If the setting does not exist, add the Name and Value setting at the
bottom of screen.

    Note: The VM must be powered off to configure the advanced settings through
the vSphere Web Client so it is recommended to configure these settings with
PowerCLI as it can be done while the VM is powered on. Settings do not take
effect via either method until the virtual machine is cold started, not
rebooted.

    or

    From a PowerCLI command prompt while connected to the ESXi host or vCenter
server, run the following command:

    If the setting does not exist, run:

    Get-VM \"VM Name\" | New-AdvancedSetting -Name
isolation.tools.diskShrink.disable -Value true

    If the setting exists, run:

    Get-VM \"VM Name\" | Get-AdvancedSetting -Name
isolation.tools.diskShrink.disable | Set-AdvancedSetting -Value true
