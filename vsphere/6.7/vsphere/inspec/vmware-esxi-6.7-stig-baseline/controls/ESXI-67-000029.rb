  desc  "ESXi hosts come with SSH, which can be enabled to allow remote access
without requiring user authentication.Â To enable password-free access, copy the
remote user's public key into the \"/etc/ssh/keys-root/authorized_keys\" file
on the ESXi host.

    The presence of the remote user's public key in the \"authorized_keys\"
file identifies the user as trusted, meaning the user is granted access to the
host without providing a password.

    If using Lockdown Mode and SSH is disabled, then logon with authorized keys
will have the same restrictions as username/password.
