Acceptance Levels must be verified."

VIB represents untested code installed on an ESXi host. The ESXi Image profile
supports four acceptance levels:

    1. VMwareCertified - VIBs created, tested, and signed by VMware
    2. VMwareAccepted - VIBs created by a VMware partner but tested and signed
by VMware
    3. PartnerSupported - VIBs created, tested, and signed by a certified
VMware partner
    4. CommunitySupported - VIBs that have not been tested by VMware or a
VMware partner

    CommunitySupported VIBs are not supported and do not have a digital
signature. To protect the security and integrity of ESXi hosts, do not allow
unsigned (CommunitySupported) VIBs to be installed on hosts.

    From the vSphere Client, select the ESXi host and go to Configure >> System
>> Security Profile.

    Under \"Host Image Profile Acceptance Level\", view the acceptance level.

    or

    From a PowerCLI command prompt while connected to the ESXi host, run the
following commands:

    $esxcli = Get-EsxCli -v2
    $esxcli.software.acceptance.get.Invoke()

    If the acceptance level is \"CommunitySupported\", this is a finding.

    Under \"Host Image Profile Acceptance Level\", click \"Edit\".

    Using the pull-down selection, set the acceptance level to be
\"VMwareCertified\", \"VMwareAccepted\", or \"PartnerSupported\".

    or

    From a PowerCLI command prompt while connected to the ESXi host, run the
following commands:

    $esxcli = Get-EsxCli -v2
    $arguments = $esxcli.software.acceptance.set.CreateArgs()
    $arguments.level = \"PartnerSupported\"
    $esxcli.software.acceptance.set.Invoke($arguments)

    Note: \"VMwareCertified\" or \"VMwareAccepted\" may be substituted for
\"PartnerSupported\", depending on local requirements. These are also case
sensitive.
