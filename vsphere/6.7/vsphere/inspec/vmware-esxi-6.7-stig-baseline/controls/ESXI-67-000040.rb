    The following are prerequisites to configuration of smart card
authentication for the ESXi DCUI:

    - Active Directory domain that supports smart card authentication, smart
card readers, and smart cards;
    - ESXi joined to an Active Directory domain; and
    - Trusted certificates for root and intermediary certificate authorities.

    From the vSphere Client, select the ESXi host and go to Configure >> System
>> Authentication Services, click \"Edit\", and check the \"Enable Smart Card
Authentication\" checkbox.

    At the \"Certificates\" tab, click the green plus sign to import trusted
certificate authority certificates and click \"OK\".
