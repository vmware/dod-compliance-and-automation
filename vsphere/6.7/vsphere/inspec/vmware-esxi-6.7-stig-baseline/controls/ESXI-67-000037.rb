  desc  "Join ESXi hosts to an Active Directory (AD) domain to eliminate the
need to create and maintain multiple local user accounts. Using AD for user
authentication simplifies the ESXi host configuration, ensures password
complexity and reuse policies are enforced, and reduces the risk of security
breaches and unauthorized access.

    Note: If the AD group \"ESX Admins\" (default) exists, then all users and
groups that are assigned as members to this group will have full administrative
access to all ESXi hosts the domain.

    From the vSphere Client, select the ESXi host and go to Configure >> System
>> Authentication Services.

    Verify the \"Directory Services Type\" is set to \"Active Directory\".

    or

    From a PowerCLI command prompt while connected to the ESXi host, run the
following command:

    Get-VMHost | Get-VMHostAuthentication

    For systems that do not use Active Directory and have no local user
accounts, other than root and/or vpxuser, this is Not Applicable.

    For systems that do not use Active Directory and do have local user
accounts, other than root and/or vpxuser, this is a finding.

    If the \"Directory Services Type\" is not set to \"Active Directory\", this
is a finding.

to join machines to AD (use UPN naming – user@domain), and then click \"OK\".
