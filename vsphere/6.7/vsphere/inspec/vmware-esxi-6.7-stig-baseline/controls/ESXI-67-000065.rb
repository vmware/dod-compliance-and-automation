values reserved by upstream physical switches."

purposes and often disallow traffic configured to these values. For example,
Cisco Catalyst switches typically reserve VLANs 1001-1024 and 4094, while Nexus
switches typically reserve 3968-4047 and 4094. Check the documentation for the
specific switch. Using a reserved VLAN might result in a denial of service on

VLAN tags and verify they are not set to a reserved VLAN ID.

    From a PowerCLI command prompt while connected to the ESXi host, run the
following command:

    Get-VirtualPortGroup | Select Name, VLanId
