    At the command line, execute the following command:

    # auditctl -l | grep \"^-w /usr/bin/passwd\"

    Expected result:

    -w /usr/bin/passwd -p x -k passwd

    If the output does not match the expected result, this is a finding.

    Note: This check depends on the auditd service to be in a running state for
accurate results. Enabling the auditd service is done as part of a separate
control.
