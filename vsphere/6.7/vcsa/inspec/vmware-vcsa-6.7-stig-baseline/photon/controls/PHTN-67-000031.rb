  title "The Photon operating system must enforce a minimum eight-character
password length."
  desc  "The shorter the password, the lower the number of possible
combinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised.

    Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a
password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks. Password
length is one factor of several that helps to determine strength and how long
it takes to crack a password. Use of more characters in a password helps to
exponentially increase the time and/or resources required to compromise the
password.

    At the command line, execute the following command:

    # grep pam_cracklib /etc/pam.d/system-password|grep --color=always
\"minlen=..\"

    Expected result:

    password requisite pam_cracklib.so dcredit=-1 ucredit=-1 lcredit=-1
ocredit=-1 minlen=8 minclass=4 difok=4 retry=3 maxsequence=0 enforce_for_root

    If the output does not match the expected result, this is a finding.

    Open /etc/applmgmt/appliance/system-password with a text editor.

    Comment out any existing \"pam_cracklib.so\" line and add the following:

    password requisite pam_cracklib.so dcredit=-1 ucredit=-1 lcredit=-1
ocredit=-1 minlen=8 minclass=4 difok=4 retry=3 maxsequence=0 enforce_for_root

    Save and close.
