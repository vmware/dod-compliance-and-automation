  title "The Photon operating system must audit the execution of privileged
functions."
  desc  "Misuse of privileged functions, either intentionally or
unintentionally by authorized users, or by unauthorized external entities that
have compromised information system accounts, is a serious and ongoing concern
and can have significant adverse impacts on organizations. Auditing the use of
privileged functions is one way to detect such misuse and identify the risk
from insider threats and the advanced persistent threat.

    At the command line, execute the following command to obtain a list of
setuid files:

    # find / -xdev -perm -4000 -type f -o -perm -2000 -type f

    Execute the following command for each setuid file found in the first
command:

    # grep <setuid_path> /etc/audit/audit.rules

    Replace <setuid_path> with each path found in the first command.

    If each <setuid_path> does not have a corresponding line in the audit
rules, this is a finding.

    A typical corresponding line will look like the following:

    -a always,exit -F path=<setuid_path> -F perm=x -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=-1 -k
privileged

    Note: This check depends on the auditd service to be in a running state for
accurate results. Enabling the auditd service is done as part of a separate
control.

following line:

    Replace <setuid_path> with each path found in the first command.
