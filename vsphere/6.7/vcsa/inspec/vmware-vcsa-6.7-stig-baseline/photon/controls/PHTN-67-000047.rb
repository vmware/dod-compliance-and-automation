  title 'The Photon operating system must audit all account removal actions.'
  desc  "When operating system accounts are removed, user accessibility is
affected. Accounts are used for identifying individual users or the operating
system processes themselves. To detect and respond to events affecting user
accessibility and system processing, operating systems must audit account
removal actions."

    At the command line, execute the following command:

    # auditctl -l | grep -E \"(userdel|groupdel)\"

    Expected result:

    -w /usr/sbin/userdel -p x -k userdel
    -w /usr/sbin/groupdel -p x -k groupdel

    If the output does not match the expected result, this is a finding.

    Note: This check depends on the auditd service to be in a running state for
accurate results. Enabling the auditd service is done as part of a separate
control.
