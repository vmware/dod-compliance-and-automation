static display data to credentials used to log in to the hosted application.
Even when data appears to be static, the non-displayed logic in a web page may
expose business logic or trusted system relationships. The integrity of all the
data being exchanged between the user and web server must always be trusted. To
protect the integrity and trust, encryption methods should be used to protect
the complete communication session.

    To protect the integrity and confidentiality of the remote sessions, VAMI
