servlet installed."
  desc  "Web Distributed Authoring (WebDAV) is an extension to the HTTP
protocol that, when developed, was meant to allow users to create, change, and
move documents on a server, typically a web server or web share. WebDAV is not
widely used and has serious security concerns because it may allow clients to
modify unauthorized files on the web server and must therefore be disabled.

    Tomcat uses the org.apache.catalina.servlets.WebdavServlet servlet to
provide WebDAV services. Because the WebDAV service has been found to have an
excessive number of vulnerabilities, this servlet must not be installed.
vSphere UI does not configure WebDAV by default."
