  desc  "Log data is essential in the investigation of events. If log data were
to become compromised, then competent forensic analysis and discovery of the
true source of potentially malicious system activity would be difficult, if not
impossible, to achieve. In addition, access to log records provides information
an attacker could potentially use to their advantage since each event record
might contain communication ports, protocols, services, trust relationships,
user names, etc. The vSphere UI restricts all access to log file by default but
this configuration must be verified."
