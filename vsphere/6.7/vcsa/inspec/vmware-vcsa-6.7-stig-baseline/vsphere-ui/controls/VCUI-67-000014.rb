  title "vSphere UI must be configured with memory leak protection."
  desc  "The Java Runtime environment can cause a memory leak or lock files
under certain conditions. Without memory leak protection, vSphere UI can
continue to consume system resources which will lead to OutOfMemoryErrors when
re-loading web applications.

    Memory leaks occur when JRE code uses the context class loader to load a
singleton as this will cause a memory leak if a web application class loader
happens to be the context class loader at the time. The
JreMemoryLeakPreventionListener class is designed to initialise these
singletons when Tomcat's common class loader is the context class loader.
Proper use of JRE memory leak protection will ensure that the hosted
application does not consume system resources and cause an unstable environment."
