  title 'VMware Postgres must require authentication on all connections.'
  desc  "To ensure accountability and prevent unauthenticated access,
organizational users must be identified and authenticated to prevent potential
misuse and compromise of the system.

    VMware Postgres client authentication is configured in \"pg_hba.conf\". In
this file are a number of lines that specify who can connect to the service,
from where, and using what authentication methods. In Postgres there is a
concept of a trusted connection where a specific network mask can connect
without any authentication, to any account. This connection is termed \"trust\"
in \"pg_hba.conf\" and it must not be present. Out of the box, VMware Postgres
requires standard password authentication for all connections.

  desc  'rationale', ''
  desc  'check', "
    At the command prompt, execute the following command:

    # grep -v \"^#\" /storage/db/vpostgres/pg_hba.conf|grep -z --color=always
\"trust\"

    If any lines are returned, this is a finding.
  "
  desc 'fix', "
    Navigate to and open /storage/db/pgdata/pg_hba.conf.

    Find and remove the line that has a method of \"trust\" in the far right
column.

    A correct, typical line will look like the following:
    # TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD
    host       all                        all                 127.0.0.1/32
