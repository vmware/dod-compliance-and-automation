  title "VMware Postgres must enforce authorized access to all PKI private
keys."
  desc  "The DoD standard for authentication is DoD-approved PKI certificates.
PKI certificate-based authentication is performed by requiring the certificate
holder to cryptographically prove possession of the corresponding private key.

    If the private key is stolen, an attacker can use the private key(s) to
impersonate the certificate holder.  In cases where the DBMS-stored private
keys are used to authenticate the DBMS to the systemâ€™s clients, loss of the
corresponding private keys would allow an attacker to successfully perform
undetected man-in-the-middle attacks against the DBMS system and its clients.

    All access to the private key(s) of the DBMS must be restricted to
authorized and authenticated users.
