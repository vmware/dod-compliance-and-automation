permitted."
  desc "Resource exhaustion can occur when an unlimited number of concurrent
requests are allowed on a website, facilitating a denial-of-service attack.
Unless the number of requests is controlled, the web server can consume enough
system resources to cause a system crash.

    Mitigating this kind of attack will include limiting the number of
concurrent HTTP/HTTPS requests. In Virgo, each incoming request requires a
thread for the duration of that request. If more simultaneous requests are
received than can be handled by the currently available request processing
threads, additional threads will be created up to the value of the
\"maxThreads\" attribute.
