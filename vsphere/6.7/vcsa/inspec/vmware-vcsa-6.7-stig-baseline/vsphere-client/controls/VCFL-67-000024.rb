information."
  desc  "Web servers will often display error messages to client users,
displaying enough information to aid in the debugging of the error. The
information given back in error messages may display the web server type,
version, patches installed, plug-ins and modules installed, type of code being
used by the hosted application, and any backends being used for data storage.

    This information could be used by an attacker to blueprint what type of
attacks might be successful. Therefore, vSphere Client must be configured to
not show server version information in error messages.
