  desc  "Web servers provide numerous processes, features, and functionalities
that use TCP/IP ports. Some of these processes may be deemed unnecessary or too
unsecure to run on a production system. vSphere Client comes configured with
two connectors. One is behind the reverse proxy and listening on 9090, and the
other is serving SSL natively on 9443. The ports that vSphere Client listens on
must be verified as accurate to their shipping state."

    At the command prompt, execute the following command:

/usr/lib/vmware-vsphere-client/server/configuration/tomcat-server.xml

    Expected result:

    port=\"9090\" port=\"9443\"

    If the output does not match the expected result, this is a finding.
