  desc  "Invalid user input occurs when a user inserts data or characters into
a hosted application's data entry field and the hosted application is
unprepared to process that data. This results in unanticipated application
behavior, potentially leading to an application compromise. Invalid user input
is one of the primary methods employed when attempting to compromise an
application.

    An attacker can also enter Unicode characters into hosted applications in
an effort to break out of the document home or root home directory or to bypass
security checks. vSphere Client must be configured to use a consistent
character set via the \"URIEncoding\" attribute on the Connector nodes.
