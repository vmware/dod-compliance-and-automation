These logs contain information including, but not limited to, power events,
system failure information, tools status and activity, time sync, virtual
hardware changes, vMotion migrations and machine clones. By default, the size
of these logs is unlimited and they are only rotated on vMotion or power
events. This can cause storage issues at scale for VMs that do not vMotion or
power cycle often."

    Get-VM \"VM Name\" | Get-AdvancedSetting -Name vmx.log.rotateSize

Configuration. Find the \"vmx.log.rotateSize\" value and set it to \"2048000\".

    Note: The VM must be powered off to modify the advanced settings through
the vSphere Client. It is recommended to configure these settings with PowerCLI
as this can be done while the VM is powered on. In this case the modified
settings will not take effect until a cold boot of the VM.

    From a PowerCLI command prompt while connected to the ESXi host or vCenter
server, run the following command:

    If the setting does not exist, run:

    Get-VM \"VM Name\" | New-AdvancedSetting -Name vmx.log.rotateSize -Value
2048000

    If the setting exists, run:

    Get-VM \"VM Name\" | Get-AdvancedSetting -Name vmx.log.rotateSize |
