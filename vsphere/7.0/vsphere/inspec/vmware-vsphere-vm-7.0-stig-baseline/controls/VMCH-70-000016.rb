prevented on the virtual machine."
  desc  "In a virtual machine, users and processes without root or
administrator privileges can connect or disconnect devices, such as network
adaptors and CD-ROM drives, and can modify device settings. Use the virtual
machine settings editor or configuration editor to remove unneeded or unused
hardware devices. If you want to use the device again, you can prevent a user
or running process in the virtual machine from connecting, disconnecting, or
modifying a device from within the guest operating system. By default, a rogue
user with nonadministrator privileges in a virtual machine can:
    1. Connect a disconnected CD-ROM drive and access sensitive information on
the media left in the drive
    2. Disconnect a network adaptor to isolate the virtual machine from its
network, which is a denial of service
    3. Modify settings on a device

    From the vSphere Client right-click the Virtual Machine and go to Edit
Settings >> VM Options >> Advanced >> Configuration Parameters >> Edit
Configuration. Verify the isolation.device.connectable.disable value is set to
true.

    or

    From a PowerCLI command prompt while connected to the ESXi host or vCenter
server, run the following command:

    Get-VM \"VM Name\" | Get-AdvancedSetting -Name
isolation.device.connectable.disable

    If the virtual machine advanced setting
isolation.device.connectable.disable does not exist or is not set to true, this
is a finding.

    From the vSphere Client right-click the Virtual Machine and go to Edit
Settings >> VM Options >> Advanced >> Configuration Parameters >> Edit
Configuration. Find the isolation.device.connectable.disable value and set it
to true. If the setting does not exist, add the Name and Value setting at the
bottom of screen.

    Note: The VM must be powered off to configure the advanced settings through
the vSphere Client so it is recommended to configure these settings with
PowerCLI as it can be done while the VM is powered on. Settings do not take
effect via either method until the virtual machine is cold started, not
rebooted.

    or

    From a PowerCLI command prompt while connected to the ESXi host or vCenter
server, run the following command:

    If the setting does not exist, run:

    Get-VM \"VM Name\" | New-AdvancedSetting -Name
isolation.device.connectable.disable -Value true

    If the setting exists, run:

    Get-VM \"VM Name\" | Get-AdvancedSetting -Name
isolation.device.connectable.disable | Set-AdvancedSetting -Value true
