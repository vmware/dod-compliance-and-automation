vSphere 6.5 this transfer can be transparently encrypted\xC2\xA0using 256bit
AES-GCM with negligible performance impact. vSphere 6.5 enables encrypted
vMotion by default as 'Opportunistic', meaning that encrypted channels are used
where supported but the operation will continue in plain text where encryption
is not supported. For example when vMotioning between two 6.5 hosts encryption
will always be utilized but since 6.0 and earlier releases do not support this
feature vMotion from a 6.5 host to a 6.0 host would be allowed but would not be
encrypted. If this finding is set to 'Required' then vMotions to unsupported
hosts will fail. This setting must be set to 'Opportunistic' or 'Required'."
