  title "The vCenter Server must limit membership to the
SystemConfiguration.BashShellAdministrators SSO group."
  desc  "vCenter SSO integrates with PAM in the underlying Photon operating
system so that members of the SystemConfiguration.BashShellAdministrators SSO
group can log on to the operating system without needing a separate account.
The caveat to this is that even though unique SSO users log on, they are
transparently using a group account named \"sso-user\" as far as Photon
auditing is concerned. While the audit trail can still be traced back to the
individual SSO user, it is a more involved process.

    In order to force accountability and non-repudiation, the SSO group
SystemConfiguration.BashShellAdministrators must be severly restricted.

    From the vSphere Client, go to Administration >> Single Sign On >> Users
and Groups >> Groups. Click the next page arrow until you see the
\"SystemConfiguration.BashShellAdministrators\" group. Click
\"SystemConfiguration.BashShellAdministrators\". Review the members of the
group and ensure that only authorized accounts are present. Remember, these
accounts act as root on the Phtoon operating system and have the ability to
severely damage vCenter, inadvertently or otherwise.

    If there are any accounts present as members of
SystemConfiguration.BashShellAdministrators that are not authorized, this is a
finding.
