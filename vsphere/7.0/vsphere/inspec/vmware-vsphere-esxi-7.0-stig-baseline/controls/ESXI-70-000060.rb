  title "All port groups on standard switches must be configured to reject
guest MAC address changes."
  desc  "If the virtual machine operating system changes the MAC address, it
can send frames with an impersonated source MAC address at any time. This
allows it to stage malicious attacks on the devices in a network by
impersonating a network adaptor authorized by the receiving network. This will
prevent VMs from changing their effective MAC address. It will affect
applications that require this functionality. This will also affect how a layer
2 bridge will operate. This will also affect applications that require a
specific MAC address for licensing. Reject MAC Changes can be set at the
vSwitch and/or the Portgroup level. You can override switch level settings at
the Portgroup level."

    Note: This control addresses ESXi standard switches. Distributed switches
are addressed in the vCenter STIG. If there is no standard switch on the ESXi
host, this is not applicable.

    From the vSphere Client go to Hosts and Clusters >> Select the ESXi Host >>
Configure >> Networking >> Virtual Switches. On each standard switch, click the
'...' button next to each port group. Click \"View Settings\". Click the
\"Policies\" tab. Verify that \"MAC Address Changes\" is set to \"Reject\".

    or

    From a PowerCLI command prompt while connected to the ESXi host run the
following command(s):

    Get-VirtualSwitch | Get-SecurityPolicy
    Get-VirtualPortGroup | Get-SecurityPolicy

    If the \"MAC Address Changes\" policy is set to \"Accept\" (or true, via
PowerCLI), this is a finding.
