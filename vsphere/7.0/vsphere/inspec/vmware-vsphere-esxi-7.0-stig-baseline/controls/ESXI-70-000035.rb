by disabling SSH."
  desc  "The ESXi Shell is an interactive command line interface (CLI)
available at the ESXi server console. The ESXi shell provides temporary access
to commands essential for server maintenance. Intended primarily for use in
break-fix scenarios, the ESXi shell is well suited for checking and modifying
configuration details, not always generally accessible, using the vSphere
Client. The ESXi shell is accessible remotely using SSH by users with the
Administrator role. Under normal operating conditions, SSH access to the host
must be disabled as is the default. As with the ESXi shell, SSH is also
intended only for temporary use during break-fix scenarios. SSH must therefore
be disabled under normal operating conditions and must only be enabled for
diagnostics or troubleshooting. Remote access to the host must therefore be
limited to the vSphere Client or Host Client at all other times."

    If the SSH service is \"Running\", this is a finding.
