need to create and maintain multiple local user accounts. Using AD for user
authentication simplifies the ESXi host configuration, ensures password
complexity and reuse policies are enforced and reduces the risk of security
breaches and unauthorized access. Note: If the AD group \"ESX Admins\"
(default) exists then all users and groups that are assigned as members to this
group will have full administrative access to all ESXi hosts the domain."
