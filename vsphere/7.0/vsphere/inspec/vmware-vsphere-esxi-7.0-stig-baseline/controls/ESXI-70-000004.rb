  desc  "Remote logging to a central log host provides a secure, centralized
store for ESXi logs. By gathering host log files onto a central host it can
more easily monitor all hosts with a single tool. It can also do aggregate
analysis and searching to look for such things as coordinated attacks on
multiple hosts. Logging to a secure, centralized log server also helps prevent
log tampering and also provides a long-term audit record."

    From the vSphere Client go to Hosts and Clusters >> Select the ESXi Host >>
Configure >> System >> Advanced System Settings. Select the
\"Syslog.global.logHost\" value and verify it is set to a site specific syslog
server. Follow the following conventions:

    udp://<IP/FQDN>:514

    Multiple servers can be specified when separated by commas.

    From a PowerCLI command prompt while connected to the ESXi host run the
following command:

    Get-VMHost | Get-AdvancedSetting -Name Syslog.global.logHost

    If the \"Syslog.global.logHost\" setting is not set to a valid, site
specific syslog server, this is a finding.
