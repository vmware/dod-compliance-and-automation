IP-based storage configurations. IP-based storage includes vSAN, iSCSI and NFS.
This configuration might expose IP-based storage traffic to unauthorized
virtual machine users. IP-based storage frequently is not encrypted. It can be
viewed by anyone with access to this network. To restrict unauthorized users
from viewing the IP-based storage traffic, the IP-based storage network must be
logically separated from any other traffic. Configuring the IP-based storage
adaptors on separate VLANs or network segments from other VMkernels and Virtual
Machines will limit unauthorized users from viewing the traffic."

Networking >> VMkernel adapters. Select each IP-base storage VMkernel adapter
and, in the bottom pane, view the \"Enabled services\".

this is a finding.

    From the vSphere Client select the ESXi host and go to Configure >>
Networking >> VMkernel adapters. Review the VLANs associated with any IP-Based
storage VMkernels and verify they are dedicated for that purpose and are
logically separated from other functions.

this is a finding.

    If IP-based storage is not used, this is not applicable.
