    Get-VM \"VM Name\" | Get-AdvancedSetting -Name isolation.tools.copy.disable

    From the vSphere Client right-click the Virtual Machine and go to Edit Settings >> VM Options >> Advanced >> Configuration Parameters >> Edit Configuration.

    Find the \"isolation.tools.copy.disable\" value and set it to \"true\".

    If the setting does not exist, add the Name and Value setting at the bottom of screen.

    Note: The VM must be powered off to configure the advanced settings through the vSphere Client so it is recommended to configure these settings with PowerCLI as it can be done while the VM is powered on. Settings do not take effect via either method until the virtual machine is cold started, not rebooted.

    or

    From a PowerCLI command prompt while connected to the ESXi host or vCenter server, run the following command:

    If the setting does not exist, run:

    Get-VM \"VM Name\" | New-AdvancedSetting -Name isolation.tools.copy.disable -Value true

    If the setting exists, run:

    Get-VM \"VM Name\" | Get-AdvancedSetting -Name isolation.tools.copy.disable | Set-AdvancedSetting -Value true
