    Remote management services, such as terminal services and SSH, must be used to interact with virtual machines.

    VM console access should only be granted when remote management services are unavailable or insufficient to perform necessary management tasks.

    Ask the SA if a VM console is used to perform VM management tasks, other than for troubleshooting VM issues.

    If a VM console is used to perform VM management tasks, other than for troubleshooting VM issues, this is a finding.

    If SSH and/or terminal management services are exclusively used to perform management tasks, this is not a finding.
  "
  desc 'fix', "
    Develop a policy prohibiting the use of a VM console for performing management services.

    This policy should include procedures for the use of SSH and Terminal Management services for VM management.

    Where SSH and Terminal Management services prove insufficient to troubleshoot a VM, access to the VM console may be temporarily granted.
