    Web servers will often display error messages to client users displaying enough information to aid in the debugging of the error. The information given back in error messages may display the web server type, version, patches installed, plug-ins and modules installed, type of code being used by the hosted application, and any backends being used for data storage.

    This information could be used by an attacker to blueprint what type of attacks might be successful. As such, Lookup Service must be configured to hide the server version at all times.

    At the command prompt, execute the following command:

    # xmllint --xpath '/Server/Service/Connector[@port=\"${bio-custom.http.port}\"]/@server' /usr/lib/vmware-lookupsvc/conf/server.xml

    Expected result:

    server=\"Anonymous\"

    If the output does not match the expected result, this is a finding.
