  title 'The Photon operating system must audit the execution of privileged functions.'
  desc 'Misuse of privileged functions, either intentionally or unintentionally by authorized users, or by unauthorized external entities that have compromised information system accounts, is a serious and ongoing concern and can have significant adverse impacts on organizations. Auditing the use of privileged functions is one way to detect such misuse and identify the risk from insider threats and the advanced persistent threat.

  desc 'check', 'At the command line, run the following command to obtain a list of setuid files:

# find / -xdev -path /var/lib/containerd -prune -o \\( -perm -4000 -type f -o -perm -2000 \\) -type f -print | sort

Run the following command for each setuid file found in the first command:

# auditctl -l | grep <setuid_path>

Replace <setuid_path> with each path found in the first command.

If each <setuid_path> does not have a corresponding line in the audit rules, this is a finding.

A typical corresponding line will look like the following:

-a always,exit -S all -F path=<setuid_path> -F perm=x -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=-1 -F key=privileged

Note: The auid!= parameter may display as 4294967295 or -1, which are equivalent.

Note: This check depends on the auditd service to be in a running state for accurate results. The auditd service is enabled in control PHTN-30-000013.'

Execute the following for each setuid file found in the first command that does not have a corresponding line in the audit rules:

Navigate to and open:

/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.STIG.rules

Add the following line:

-a always,exit -F path=<setuid_path> -F perm=x -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -F key=privileged

Execute the following command to load the new audit rules:

# /sbin/augenrules --load

Note: A new "audit.STIG.rules" file is provided for placement in "/etc/audit/rules.d" that contains all rules needed for auditd.

Note: An older "audit.STIG.rules" may exist if the file exists and references older "GEN" SRG IDs. This file can be removed and replaced as necessary with an updated one.'
