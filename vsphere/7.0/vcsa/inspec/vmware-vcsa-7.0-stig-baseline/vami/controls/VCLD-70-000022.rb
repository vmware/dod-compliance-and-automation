When debugging or trace information is enabled in a production web server, information about the web server, such as web server type, version, patches installed, plug-ins and modules installed, type of code being used by the hosted application, and any backends being used for data storage may be displayed.

Because this information may be placed in logs and general messages during normal operation of the web server, an attacker does not need to cause an error condition to gain this information.'
