  title 'VAMI must disable client initiated TLS renegotiation.'
  desc  "All versions of the SSL and TLS protocols (up to and including
TLS/1.2) are vulnerable to a Man-in-the-Middle attack (CVE-2009-3555) during a
renegotiation. This vulnerability allowed an attacker to \"prefix\" a chosen
plaintext to the HTTP request as seen by the web server. The protocols have
since been ammended by RFC5746 but the fix must be supported by both client and
server to be effective. While lighttpd and the underlying openssl libraries are
no longer vulnerable, steps must be taken to account for older clients that do
not support RFC5746. To this end, lighttpd disables client initiated
renegotiation entirely by default. This configuration must be validated and
maintained."

\"ssl\\.disable-client-renegotiation\"|sed 's: ::g'

\"ssl.disable-client-renegotiation\" is set to \"disabled\", this is a finding.
