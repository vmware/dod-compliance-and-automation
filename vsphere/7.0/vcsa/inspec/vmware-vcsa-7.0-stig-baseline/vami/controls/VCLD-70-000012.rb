  desc  "Controlling what a user of a hosted application can access is part of
the security posture of the web server. Any time a user can access more
functionality than is needed for the operation of the hosted application poses
a security issue. A user with too much access can view information that is not
needed for the user's job role, or the user could use the function in an
unintentional manner.

    A MIME tells the web server what type of program various file types and
extensions are and what external utilities or programs are needed to execute
the file type. A limited number of MIME types must be configured manually and
automatic mapping must be disabled.
