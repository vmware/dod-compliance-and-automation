  title 'VAMI must be configured with FIPS 140-2 compliant ciphers for HTTPS connections.'
  desc  "
    Encryption of data in flight is an essential element of protecting information confidentiality. If a web server uses weak or outdated encryption algorithms, the server's communications could be compromised.

    The U.S. Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) publication 140-2, Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules (FIPS 140-2), identifies 11 areas for a cryptographic module used inside a security system that protects information. FIPS 140-2 approved ciphers provide the maximum level of encryption possible for a private web server.

    VAMI is compiled to use VMware's FIPS-validated OpenSSL module and cannot be configured otherwise. Ciphers may still be specified in order of preference, but no non-FIPS approved ciphers will be implemented.

    At the command prompt, run the following command:

    # /opt/vmware/sbin/vami-lighttpd -p -f /opt/vmware/etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf 2>/dev/null|grep \"ssl.cipher-list\"|sed -e 's/^[ ]*//'

    Expected result:

    ssl.cipher-list                   = \"!aNULL:kECDH+AESGCM:ECDH+AESGCM:RSA+AESGCM:kECDH+AES:ECDH+AES:RSA+AES\"

    If the output does not match the expected result, this is a finding.

    Note: The command must be run from a bash shell and not from a shell generated by the \"appliance shell\". Use the \"chsh\" command to change the shell for the account to \"/bin/bash\". Refer to KB Article 2100508 for more details:

    Navigate to and open:

    /etc/applmgmt/appliance/lighttpd.conf

    Add or reconfigure the following value:

    ssl.cipher-list                   = \"!aNULL:kECDH+AESGCM:ECDH+AESGCM:RSA+AESGCM:kECDH+AES:ECDH+AES:RSA+AES\"

    Restart the service with the following command:

    # vmon-cli --restart applmgmt
