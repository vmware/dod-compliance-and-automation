resources."
  desc  "When it comes to DoS attacks, most of the attention is paid to
ensuring that systems and applications are not victims of these attacks. While
it is true that those accountable for systems want to ensure they are not
affected by a DoS attack, they also need to ensure their systems and
applications are not used to launch such an attack against others. To that
extent, a variety of technologies exist to limit, or in some cases, eliminate
the effects of DoS attacks. Limiting system resources that are allocated to any
user to a bare minimum may also reduce the ability of users to launch some DoS
attacks.

    One DoS mitigation is to prevent VAMI from keeping idle connections open
for too long.

    If the output does not match the expected result, this is a finding.
