  desc  "Denial of Service is one threat against web servers.  Many DoS attacks
attempt to consume web server resources in such a way that no more resources
are available to satisfy legitimate requests.  Mitigation against these threats
is to take steps to  limit the number of resources that can be consumed in
certain ways.

    VAMI provides the maxConnections attribute of the <Connector Elements> to
limit the number of concurrent TCP connections. This comes per-configured with
a tested, supported value that must be verified and maintained.
