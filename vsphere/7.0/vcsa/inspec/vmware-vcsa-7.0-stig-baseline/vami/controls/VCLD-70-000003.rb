  desc  "Data exchanged between the user and the web server can range from
static display data to credentials used to log in the hosted application. Even
when data appears to be static, the non-displayed logic in a web page may
expose business logic or trusted system relationships. The integrity of all the
data being exchanged between the user and web server must always be trusted. To
protect the integrity and trust, encryption methods should be used to protect
the complete communication session.

    To order to protect the integrity and confidentiality of the remote
sessions, VAMI uses SSL/TLS.

    At the command prompt, execute the following command:

    # /opt/vmware/sbin/vami-lighttpd -p -f
/opt/vmware/etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf 2>/dev/null|grep \"ssl.engine\"|sed -e
's/^[ ]*//'

    Expected result:

    ssl.engine                 = \"enable\"

    If the output does not match the expected result, this is a finding.

    Note: The command must be run from a bash shell and not from a shell
generated by the \"appliance shell\". Use the \"chsh\" command to change the
shell for your account to \"/bin/bash\". See KB Article 2100508 for more
details.
