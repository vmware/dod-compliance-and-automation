  desc 'Data exchanged between the user and the web server can range from static display data to credentials used to log in the hosted application. Even when data appears to be static, the nondisplayed logic in a web page may expose business logic or trusted system relationships. The integrity of all the data being exchanged between the user and web server must always be trusted. To protect the integrity and trust, encryption methods should be used to protect the complete communication session.

To protect the integrity and confidentiality of the remote sessions, VAMI uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS).
