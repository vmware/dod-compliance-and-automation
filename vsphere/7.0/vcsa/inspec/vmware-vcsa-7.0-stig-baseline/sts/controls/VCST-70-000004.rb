    Cookies are a common way to save session state over the HTTP(S) protocol. If an attacker can compromise session data stored in a cookie, they are better able to launch an attack against the server and its applications.

    When a cookie is tagged with the \"HttpOnly\" flag, it tells the browser that this particular cookie should only be accessed by the originating server. Any attempt to access the cookie from client script is strictly forbidden.

    At the command prompt, execute the following command:

    # xmllint --format /usr/lib/vmware-sso/vmware-sts/conf/web.xml | sed '2 s/xmlns=\".*\"//g' | xmllint --xpath '/web-app/session-config/cookie-config/http-only' -

    Expected result:

    <http-only>true</http-only>

    If the output does not match the expected result, this is a finding.
