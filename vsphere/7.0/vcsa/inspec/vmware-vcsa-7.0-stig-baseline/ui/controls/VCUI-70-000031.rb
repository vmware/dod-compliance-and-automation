    An attacker has at least two reasons to stop a web server. The first is to cause a DoS, and the second is to put in place changes the attacker made to the web server configuration. If the Tomcat shutdown port feature is enabled, a shutdown signal can be sent to vSphere UI through this port. To ensure availability, the shutdown port must be disabled.

    At the command prompt, execute the following commands:

    # xmllint --format /usr/lib/vmware-vsphere-ui/server/conf/server.xml | sed '2 s/xmlns=\".*\"//g' |  xmllint --xpath '/Server/@port' -

    Expected result:

    port=\"${shutdown.port}\"

    If the output does not match the expected result, this is a finding.

    # grep shutdown /etc/vmware/vmware-vmon/svcCfgfiles/vsphere-ui.json|sed -e 's/^[ ]*//'

    Expected result:

    \"-Dshutdown.port=-1\",

    If the output does not match the expected result, this is a finding.

  desc 'fix', "
    Navigate to and open:

    /usr/lib/vmware-vsphere-ui/server/conf/server.xml

    Make sure that the server port is disabled:

    <Server port=\"${shutdown.port}\" â€¦>

    Restart the service with the following command:

    # vmon-cli --restart vsphere-ui
