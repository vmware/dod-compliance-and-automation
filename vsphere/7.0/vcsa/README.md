# vCenter Server Appliance

## Overview
The vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) is vCenter as you know it but delivered without the dependency on Windows Server. The bundle includes a Linux operating system, a number of web servers and a database, as illustrated below. The green boxes are in scope of this STIG while the vCenter application itself is addressed separately.

In the next major version of vSphere, there will be no Windows version of vCenter so no distinction between "vCenter" and "VCSA" will be necessary.
