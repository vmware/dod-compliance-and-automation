  desc 'vCenter SSO integrates with PAM in the underlying Photon operating system so members of the "SystemConfiguration.BashShellAdministrators" SSO group can log on to the operating system without needing a separate account. However, even though unique SSO users log on, they are transparently using a group account named "sso-user" as far as Photon auditing is concerned. While the audit trail can still be traced back to the individual SSO user, it is a more involved process.

To force accountability and nonrepudiation, the SSO group "SystemConfiguration.BashShellAdministrators" must be severely restricted.'
