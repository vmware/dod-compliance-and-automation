  desc 'Untrusted certificate authorities (CA) can issue certificates, but they may be issued by organizations or individuals that seek to compromise DOD systems or by organizations with insufficient security controls. If the CA used for verifying the certificate is not a DOD-approved CA, trust of this CA has not been established.

The DOD will only accept public key infrastructure (PKI) certificates obtained from a DOD-approved internal or external certificate authority. Reliance on CAs for the establishment of secure sessions includes, for example, the use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates.

The default self-signed, VMware Certificate Authority (VMCA)-issued vCenter reverse proxy certificate must be replaced with a DOD-approved certificate. The use of a DOD certificate on the vCenter reverse proxy and other services assures clients that the service they are connecting to is legitimate and trusted.'
