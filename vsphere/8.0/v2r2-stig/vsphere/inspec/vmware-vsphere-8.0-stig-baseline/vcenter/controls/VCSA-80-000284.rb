This role must be reserved for cryptographic administrators where virtual machine encryption and/or vSAN encryption is in use.

A new built-in role called "No Cryptography Administrator" exists to provide all administrative permissions except cryptographic operations. Permissions must be restricted such that normal vSphere administrators are assigned the "No Cryptography Administrator" role or more restrictive.

The "Administrator" role must be tightly controlled and must not be applied to administrators who will not be doing cryptographic work. Catastrophic data loss can result from poorly administered cryptography.'

From the vSphere Client, go to Administration >> Access Control >> Roles.

From a PowerCLI command prompt while connected to the vCenter server, run the following command:

Get-VIPermission | Where {$_.Role -eq "Admin" -or $_.Role -eq "NoTrustedAdmin" -or $_.Role -eq "vCLSAdmin" -or $_.Role -eq "VMOperatorController" -or $_.Role -eq "vSphereKubernetesManager"} | Select Role,Principal,Entity,Propagate,IsGroup | FT -Auto
