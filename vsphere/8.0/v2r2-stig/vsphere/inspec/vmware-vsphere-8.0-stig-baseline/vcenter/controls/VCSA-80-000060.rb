Multifactor authentication requires using two or more factors to achieve authentication.

Factors include:
(i) something a user knows (e.g., password/PIN);
(ii) something a user has (e.g., cryptographic identification device, token); or
(iii) something a user is (e.g., biometric).

If a third-party identity provider is used, such as Microsoft ADFS, and it does not require multifactor authentication to log on to vCenter, this is a finding.'
