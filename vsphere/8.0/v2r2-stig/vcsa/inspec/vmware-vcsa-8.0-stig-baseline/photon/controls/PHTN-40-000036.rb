  desc 'Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks.

Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes to crack a password. The more complex the password, the greater the number of possible combinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised.'

# grep '^password.*pam_pwquality.so' /etc/pam.d/system-password

Example result:

password  requisite   pam_pwquality.so  dcredit=-1 ucredit=-1 lcredit=-1 ocredit=-1 minlen=15 difok=8 enforce_for_root dictcheck=1

If the "lcredit" option is not < 0, is missing or commented out, this is a finding.)
