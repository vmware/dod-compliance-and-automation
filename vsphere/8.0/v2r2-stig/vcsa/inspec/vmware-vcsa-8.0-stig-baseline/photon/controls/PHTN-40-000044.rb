  desc 'The shorter the password, the lower the number of possible combinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised.

Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks. Password length is one factor of several that helps to determine strength and how long it takes to crack a password. Use of more characters in a password helps to exponentially increase the time and/or resources required to compromise the password.'

# grep '^password.*pam_pwquality.so' /etc/pam.d/system-password

Example result:

password  requisite   pam_pwquality.so  dcredit=-1 ucredit=-1 lcredit=-1 ocredit=-1 minlen=15 difok=8 enforce_for_root dictcheck=1

If the "minlen" option is not >= 15, is missing or commented out, this is a finding.)
