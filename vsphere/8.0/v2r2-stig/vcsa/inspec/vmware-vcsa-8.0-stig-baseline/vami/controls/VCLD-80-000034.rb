WebDAV is an extension to the HTTP protocol that, when developed, was meant to allow users to create, change, and move documents on a server, typically a web server or web share. Allowing this functionality, development, and deployment is much easier for web authors.

WebDAV is not widely used and has serious security concerns because it may allow clients to modify unauthorized files on the web server.'
