  title 'The vCenter Lookup service must be configured to use a specified IP address and port.'
  desc  "
    The server must be configured to listen on a specified IP address and port. Without specifying an IP address and port for server to use, the server will listen on all IP addresses available.

    Accessing the hosted application through an IP address normally used for nonapplication functions opens the possibility of user access to resources, utilities, files, ports, and protocols that are protected on the desired application IP address.

    At the command prompt, run the following command:

    # xmllint --xpath \"//Connector[(@port = '0') or not(@address)]\" /usr/lib/vmware-eam/web/conf/server.xml

    Expected result:

    XPath set is empty

    If any connectors are returned, this is a finding.

    Navigate to and open:

    /usr/lib/vmware-lookupsvc/conf/server.xml

    Navigate to the <Connector> node and configure the port and address as follows:

    port=\"${bio-custom.http.port}\"
    address=\"localhost\"

    Restart the service with the following command:

    # vmon-cli --restart lookupsvc
