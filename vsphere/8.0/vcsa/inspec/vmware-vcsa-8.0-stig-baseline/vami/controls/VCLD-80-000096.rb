  title 'The vCenter VAMI service must enable honoring the SSL cipher order.'
  desc  "
    During a Transport Layer Security  (TLS) session negotiation, when choosing a cipher during a handshake, normally the client's preference is used. This is potentially problematic as a malicious, dated, or poorly configured client could select the most insecure cipher offered by the server, even if it supports stronger ones.

    If \"ssl.honor-cipher-order\" is enabled, the \"ssl.cipher-list\" setting will be treated as an ordered list of cipher values from most preferred to least, left to right.

    At the command prompt, run the following command:

    # /opt/vmware/sbin/vami-lighttpd -p -f /opt/vmware/etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf 2>/dev/null|grep \"ssl\\.honor-cipher-order\"

    Expected result:

    ssl.honor-cipher-order = \"enable\"

    If the output does not match the expected result, this is a finding.

    Note: The command must be run from a bash shell and not from a shell generated by the \"appliance shell\". Use the \"chsh\" command to change the shell for the account to \"/bin/bash\". Refer to KB Article 2100508 for more details:
