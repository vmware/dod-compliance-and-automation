  desc  "
    In UNIX and related computer operating systems, a file descriptor is an indicator used to access a file or other input/output resource, such as a pipe or network connection. File descriptors index into a per-process file descriptor table maintained by the kernel, which in turn indexes into a systemwide table of files opened by all processes, called the file table.

    As a single-threaded server, Lighttpd must be limited in the number of file descriptors that can be allocated. This will prevent Lighttpd from being used in a form of DoS attack against the operating system.

    At the command prompt, run the following command:

    # /opt/vmware/sbin/vami-lighttpd -p -f /opt/vmware/etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf 2>/dev/null|grep \"server.max-fds\"

    Expected result:

    server.max-fds=2048

    If the output does not match the expected result, this is a finding.

    Note: The command must be run from a bash shell and not from a shell generated by the \"appliance shell\". Use the \"chsh\" command to change the shell for the account to \"/bin/bash\". Refer to KB Article 2100508 for more details:

    Navigate to and open:

    Add or reconfigure the following value:

    server.max-fds = 2048

    Restart the service with the following command:

    # vmon-cli --restart applmgmt
