  title 'The vCenter Envoy service private key file must be protected from unauthorized access.'
  desc  "
    Envoy's private key is used to prove the identity of the server to clients and securely exchange the shared secret key used to encrypt communications between the web server and clients.

    By gaining access to the private key, an attacker can pretend to be an authorized server and decrypt the Transport Layer Security (TLS) traffic between a client and the web server.

    At the command prompt, run the following command:

    If the output does not match the expected result, this is a finding.
