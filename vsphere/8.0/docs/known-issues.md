# Known Issues

This document outlines known issues with the vSphere 8 STIG content, including workarounds if known.

## What should I do if...

### I have additional questions about an issue listed here?

Each known issue links off to an existing GitHub issue. If you have additional questions or feedback, please comment on the issue.

### My issue is not listed here?

Please check the [open](https://github.com/vmware/dod-compliance-and-automation/issues) and [closed](https://github.com/vmware/dod-compliance-and-automation/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) issues in the issue tracker for the details of your bug. If you can't find it, or if you're not sure, open a new issue.

## vCenter

### [VCSA-80-000009] PowerCLI cmdlets in check and fix text are not found

Related issue: None

When running the check and/or fix commands PowerCLI will error or report that the cmdlet is not found.  

**Workaround:**

- The new cmdlets did not exist until PowerCLI 13.3. Update to PowerCLI 13.3 where the cmdlets are available.  

## ESXi

### [ESXI-80-000094] PowerCLI cmdlets in check and fix text are not found

Related issue: None

When running the check and/or fix commands PowerCLI will error or report that the cmdlet is not found.

**Workaround:**

- The new cmdlets did not exist until PowerCLI 13.3. Update to PowerCLI 13.3 where the cmdlets are available.  

### [ESXI-80-000232] Persistent audit storage and capacity should be configured before enabling audit logs

Related issue: None

You may see log files under `/var/log` with a name similar to `vmsyslog.####.debug` with entries pertaining that your audit log location does not exist. This may lead to errors such as the var ramdisk being full, services failing to start, and other general issue with the ESXi host.

**Workaround:**

- The advanced settings `Syslog.global.auditRecord.storageCapacity` and `Syslog.global.logDir` should be configured and verified before enabling audit logs with the `Syslog.global.auditRecord.storageEnable` setting.
- If you have already done this and are experiencing issue follow the below steps:
  1. Make sure `Syslog.global.logDir` is configured and exists on persistent storage.
  2. Reboot the host
  3. Set `Syslog.global.auditRecord.storageEnable` to false
  4. Set `Syslog.global.auditRecord.storageEnable` to true

### [ESXI-80-000239] When attempting to configure Allowed IPs for the ESXi firewall you may see an error for some services

Related issue: None

You may see the error `Invalid operation requested: Can not change allowed ip list this ruleset, it is owned by system service.` when configuring some services.  

Due to changes in the ESXi firewall some services are unable to be configured to restrict access via a list of IP addresses or ranges. See the [8.0 U2 release notes](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/8.0/rn/vsphere-vcenter-server-802-release-notes/index.html#Known%20Issues-Miscellaneous%20Issues) for more information.  

**Workaround:**

As of 8.0 U2b most services are now once again user configurable for the Allowed IP settings. A future STIG update will clarify that services that are not user configurable are not in scope of the rule. See the below list for what is user configurable. 

```

### [ESXI-80-000239] Impact to VxRail Manager Plugin performance and VCF on VxRail add node workflows

Related issue: None

When attempting to add a new host to an existing VxRail cluster the NIC configuration may not load and/or the validation step will fail and the host will not be added. The VxRail plugin in vCenter may also experience delays in loading.

**Workaround:**

**Option 1:** (Recommended) Do not implement ESXI-80-000239 in these environments until this issue is resolved.  
**Option 2:** To add a node, disable the ESXi firewall on all hosts in the target cluster for the duration of the operation and re-enable once complete.  

If using the `VMware_vSphere_8.0_STIG_ESXi_Remediation.ps1` script provided in this repo to harden ESXi you can disable this rule by changing the variable `ESXI800000239` to `$false` before running. This can be found [here](https://github.com/vmware/dod-compliance-and-automation/blob/master/vsphere/8.0/v1r1-srg/vsphere/powercli/VMware_vSphere_8.0_STIG_ESXi_Remediation.ps1#L254).  

### [ESXI-80-000247] PowerCLI cmdlets in check and fix text are not found

Related issue: None

When running the check and/or fix commands PowerCLI will error or report that the cmdlet is not found.

**Workaround:**

- The new cmdlets did not exist until PowerCLI 13.3. Update to PowerCLI 13.3 where the cmdlets are available.

## VCSA

### [PHTN-30-000054/67] -S all is displayed in the check output

<mark style="background-color: #78BC20">**Resolved in STIG Version 1 Release 2**</mark>

Related issue: None

Since we are not specifying a specific syscall(all is implied) in the audit rules for these controls the "-S all" is displayed in the auditctl command output which is not included in the expected output in the check.  

**Workaround:**

- The check output will be updated in a future update and the output with "-S all" added can be considered compliant.

### [PHTN-30-000114] Multiple umask entries in check output

<mark style="background-color: #78BC20">**Resolved in STIG Version 1 Release 2**</mark>

Related issue: None

The check command output may show multiple umask entries such as UMASK 022 and UMASK 077.  

**Workaround:**

- Resolution included in product roadmap.  
- When multiple entries are present the last entry is enforced.  

### [VCLU-80-000037] Path incorrect in check

<mark style="background-color: #78BC20">**Resolved in STIG Version 1 Release 2**</mark>

Related issue: None

In the check command the path to the server.xml file is incorrectly referencing the eam service instead of lookupsvc.  

**Workaround:**

- The check command will be updated in a future STIG release as follows:  
```# xmllint --xpath "//Connector[(@port = '0') or not(@address)]" /usr/lib/vmware-lookupsvc/conf/server.xml```
