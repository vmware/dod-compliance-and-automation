### [PHTN-30-000054/67] -S all is displayed in the check output

Related issue: None

Since we are not specifying a specific syscall(all is implied) in the audit rules for these controls the "-S all" is displayed in the auditctl command output which is not included in the expected output in the check.  

**Workaround:**

- The check output will be updated in a future update and the output with "-S all" added can be considered compliant.

### [PHTN-30-000114] Multiple umask entries in check output

Related issue: None

The check command output may show multiple umask entries such as UMASK 022 and UMASK 077.  

**Workaround:**

- Resolution included in product roadmap.  
- When multiple entries are present the last entry is enforced.
