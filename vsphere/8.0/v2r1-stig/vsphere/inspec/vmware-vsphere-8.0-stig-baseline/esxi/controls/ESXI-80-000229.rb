Obtain a DOD-issued certificate and private key for the host following the requirements below:

Key size: 2048 bits or more (PEM encoded)

Key format: PEM
VMware supports PKCS8 and PKCS1 (RSA keys)
x509 version 3

SubjectAltName must contain DNS Name=<machine_FQDN>

CRT (Base-64) format

Contains the following Key Usages: Digital Signature, Non Repudiation, Key Encipherment

Start time of one day before the current time

CN (and SubjectAltName) set to the host name (or IP address) that the ESXi host has in the vCenter Server inventory

From the vSphere Web Client, select the ESXi host's vCenter Server >> Configure >> System >> Advanced Settings.

Select the "vpxd.certmgmt.mode" value and ensure it is set to "custom".

Put the host into maintenance mode.

Temporarily enable Secure Shell (SSH) on the host. Use Secure Copy Protocol (SCP) to transfer the new certificate and key to /tmp. SSH to the host. Back up the existing certificate and key:

# mv /etc/vmware/ssl/rui.crt /etc/vmware/ssl/rui.crt.bak
# mv /etc/vmware/ssl/rui.key /etc/vmware/ssl/rui.key.bak

Copy the new certificate and key to "/etc/vmware/ssl/" and rename them to "rui.crt" and "rui.key" respectively.

Restart management agents to implement the new certificate:
