vSAN data-in-transit encryption has the following characteristics:
-vSAN uses AES-256 bit encryption on data in transit.
-Forward secrecy is enforced for vSAN data-in-transit encryption.
-Traffic between data hosts and witness hosts is encrypted.
-File service data traffic between the VDFS proxy and VDFS server is encrypted.
-vSAN file services inter-host connections are encrypted.
-vSAN uses symmetric keys that are generated dynamically and shared between hosts. Hosts dynamically generate an encryption key when they establish a connection, and they use the key to encrypt all traffic between the hosts. You do not need a key management server to perform data-in-transit encryption.

Each host is authenticated when it joins the cluster, ensuring connections only to trusted hosts are allowed. When a host is removed from the cluster, it is authentication certificate is removed.

vSAN data-in-transit encryption is a cluster-wide setting. When enabled, all data and metadata traffic is encrypted as it transits across hosts.'
