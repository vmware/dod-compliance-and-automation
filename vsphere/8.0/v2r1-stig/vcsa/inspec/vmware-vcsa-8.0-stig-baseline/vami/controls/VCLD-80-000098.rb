  desc 'Web servers will often display error messages to client users, displaying enough information to aid in the debugging of the error. The information given back in error messages may display the web server type, version, patches installed, plug-ins and modules installed, type of code being used by the hosted application, and any backends being used for data storage.

This information could be used by an attacker to blueprint what type of attacks might be successful. Therefore, VAMI must be configured to hide the server version at all times.'

Expected result:

server.tag = "vami"

If "server.tag" is not set to "vami", this is a finding.

Note: The command must be run from a bash shell and not from a shell generated by the "appliance shell". Use the "chsh" command to change the shell for the account to "/bin/bash". Refer to KB Article 2100508 for more details:
