  desc 'By limiting the number of failed logon attempts, the risk of unauthorized system access via user password guessing, otherwise known as brute-force attacks, is reduced. Limits are imposed by locking the account.

Unless specified the root account is not included in the default faillock module options and should be included.'

Example result:

even_deny_root

If the "even_deny_root" option is not set, is missing or commented out, this is a finding.

Note: If faillock.conf is not used to configure pam_faillock.so then these options may be specified on the faillock lines in the system-auth and system-account files.)
