VCF vSphere Supervisor appliances by design are intended to be immutable and it is not supported to perform any compliance activities to the appliances.  

These appliances however are audited as part of the software development lifecycle and designed to be compliant where possible. To support needed compliance activities, such as for accreditation, we will provide compliance artifacts and make those available [here](https://github.com/vmware/dod-compliance-and-automation/tree/master/vcf/9.x/docs/reports).
