## [VCLU-80-000037] Path incorrect in check
{{% alert title="Resolved" %}}
This issue was resolved with the release of the VMware vSphere 8.0 vCenter Appliance Lookup Service STIG Readiness Guide :: Version 1, Release: 2.  
{{% /alert %}}

Related issue: None

In the check command the path to the server.xml file is incorrectly referencing the eam service instead of lookupsvc.  

### Workaround
- The check command will be updated in a future STIG release as follows:  
```# xmllint --xpath "//Connector[(@port = '0') or not(@address)]" /usr/lib/vmware-lookupsvc/conf/server.xml```
