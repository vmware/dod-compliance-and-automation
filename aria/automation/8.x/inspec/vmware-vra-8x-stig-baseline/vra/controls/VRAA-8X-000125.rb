    Verify vRA has been installed with FIPS enabled by running the following command:

    # vracli security fips

    Example output:

    FIPS mode: enabled

    If FIPS mode is not enabled, this is a finding.

  desc  'fix', "
    The only way to enable FIPS mode for vRA is by configuring the setting during the installation.

    Re-deploy a new vRA appliance into the environment with FIPS mode enabled.
