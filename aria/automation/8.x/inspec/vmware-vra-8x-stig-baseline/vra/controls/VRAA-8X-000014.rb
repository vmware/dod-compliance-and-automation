Even when data appears to be static, the non-displayed logic in a web page may expose business logic or trusted system relationships. The integrity of all data being exchanged between the user and web server must always be trusted. To protect the integrity and trust, encryption methods should be used to protect the complete communication session.'

    From the command line interface, run the following command:

    # kubectl -n ingress describe cm ingress-ctl-traefik | grep '\\[entryPoints.https\\]'

    Expected result:

    [entryPoints.https]

    If the output does not match the expected result, this is a finding.

    The presence of the https entry point indicates SSL is enabled in the ingress controller.

    Navigate to and open:

    /opt/charts/ingress-ctl/values.yaml

    Add or configure the following line:

    Under the ssl: section

    ssl:
      enabled: true

    Note: If vRA is clustered this file should be updated on all nodes.

    From the command line interface, run the following command:

    # /opt/scripts/deploy.sh

    Note: This is a service impacting command and will re-instantiate the kubernetes deployments.  This will also perform the action on all nodes if vRA is clustered.
