    Navigate to and open:

    /opt/charts/ingress-ctl/values.yaml

    Add or configure the following line:

    cpuLimit: 500m

    Note: If vRA is clustered this file should be updated on all nodes.

    From the command line interface, run the following command:

    # /opt/scripts/deploy.sh

    Note: This is a service impacting command and will re-instantiate the Kubernetes deployments.  This will also perform the action on all nodes if vRA is clustered.
