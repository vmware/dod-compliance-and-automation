    The Docker daemon can be configured to listen on other ports in several places which all must be checked to find the offending configuration.

    Navigate to and open:

    /usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service

    In the \"ExecStart\" entry, remove any statement starting with \"-H tcp://\".

    Navigate to and open:

    /etc/docker/daemon.json

    Find the \"hosts\" statement if it exists and remove any statement starting with \"tcp://\"

    Restart the docker daemon by running the following command:

    # systemctl restart docker.service
