    The Host element controls deployment. Automatic deployment allows for simpler management, but also makes it easier for an attacker to deploy a malicious application. Automatic deployment is controlled by the autoDeploy and deployOnStartup attributes. If both are false, only Contexts defined in server.xml will be deployed, and any changes will require a Tomcat restart.

    In a hosted environment where web applications may not be trusted, set the deployXML attribute to false to ignore any context.xml packaged with the web application that may try to assign increased privileges to the web application. Note that if the security manager is enabled, the deployXML attribute will default to false.

    At the command prompt, run the following command:

    # xmllint --xpath \"//Host/@deployXML\" /usr/lib/vmware-vcops/tomcat-enterprise/conf/server.xml

    Expected result:

    deployXML=\"false\"

    If \"deployXML\" does not equal \"false\", this is a finding.

    Navigate to and open the /usr/lib/vmware-vcops/tomcat-enterprise/conf/server.xml file.

    Navigate to the <Host> node and configure with the value 'deployXML=\"false\"'.

    Restart the service with the following command:

    # systemctl restart api.service
