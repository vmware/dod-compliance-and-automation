  desc  "
    Being able to verify that a patch, upgrade, certificate, etc., being added to the web server is unchanged from the producer of the file is essential for file validation and non-repudiation of the information.

    The web server or hosting system must have a mechanism to verify that files, before installation, are valid.

    Examples of validation methods are sha1 and md5 hashes and checksums.

    At the command prompt, run the following command:

    # rpm -V httpd | grep \"/usr/\" | grep -v \"httpd.service\"

    If the command produces any output, this is a finding.

    Roll back to a previous snapshot, restore from backup or deploy a new node and retire the affected one.

    There is no way to repair the Apache binaries post-deployment since the source rpms are no longer present.
