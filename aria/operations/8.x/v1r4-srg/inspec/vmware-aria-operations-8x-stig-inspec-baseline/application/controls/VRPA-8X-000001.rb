  desc  "
    Strong access controls are critical to securing the application server. Access control policies (e.g., identity-based policies, role-based policies, attribute-based policies) and access enforcement mechanisms (e.g., access control lists, access control matrices, cryptography) must be employed by the application server to control access between users (or processes acting on behalf of users) and objects (e.g., applications, files, records, processes, application domains) in the application server.

    Without stringent logical access and authorization controls, an adversary may have the ability, with very little effort, to compromise the application server and associated supporting infrastructure.
