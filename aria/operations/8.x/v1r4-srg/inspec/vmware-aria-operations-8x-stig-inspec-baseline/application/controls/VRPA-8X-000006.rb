  desc  'If communications sessions remain open for extended periods of time even when unused, there is the potential for an adversary to hijack the session and use it to gain access to the device or networks to which it is attached. Terminating sessions after a logout event or after a certain period of inactivity is a method for mitigating the risk of this vulnerability. When a user management session becomes idle, or when a user logs out of the management interface, the application server must terminate the session.'
